            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thou haſt peruſed the former Labours of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this enſuing Treatiſe, thou wilt readily be convinced that this Peice of his needs no Letters of Recommendation; theſe former Labours of his having been ſo univerſally acceptable, and to my certain knowledge now much deſiderat, both at Home among our ſelves, and alſo in our Neighbouring Nation: And no wonder, for whoever have ſeen, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently peruſed theſe his Labours, have therein had a proof of the Author's great Judgement, and ſingular dexterity in Opening and Expounding the Scriptute. Yet Cuſtom hath made an Epiſtle of this nature ſome way neceſſary, and thoſe concerned in the Publication have laid it upon me, becauſe for the preſent, I labour in the ſame part of the Lord's Vineyard, where the Reverend Author (now with the Lord) formerly laboured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I have had no ſmall Averſation from this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, partly from my own Unfitneſs, and want of Qualifications ſutable; and partly from the ſenſe I have how litle my Teſtimony can add to the Eſteem of the Works of ſuch a Man; and partly alſo, becauſe ſuch an Appearance is contrary to my own Genius and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51442:5"/>
yet I have been neceſſitat to overcome this Averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And my great Encouragement thereto is, what I have already mentioned, that the Author does not need my Recommendation, his own Works Praiſe him in the Gate, and his Praiſe is in all the Churches, ſo far as his Works are known.</p>
            <p>That therefore which I have mainly to do, is, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee that the following Treatiſe is the genuine Work of the ſame Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Alexander Nisbet,</hi> who wrote the Expoſition of the two Epiſtles of <hi>Peter;</hi> And (except the Arguments to the ſeveral Chapters) was periected and made ready for the Preſs before his Death; And had long ſince come abroad into the World, if it had not been for ſome Aſſertions the Author hath upon Chap. 8.4 Concerning Obedience to ſupreme Powers, which did not reliſh with the late Times, wherein Supremacy and Abſolute Power were ſcrewed up to the greateſt height. And it may rationally be ſuppoſed that this Peice of his is not leſs Elaborat, conſequently, will not be leſs Acceptable than the former, ſeing it is his Second Eſſay of this nature; and we uſually ſay, <hi>Secundae Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes meliores.</hi> And as <hi>Solomon</hi> is with good ground judged to have Writt this Book in his Old Age, when he had taken a more ſerious View of his paſt Life; ſo it is certain the Reverend Author, wrote this his Expoſition thereof in his Old Age, at leaſt in the latter part of his Days, when he had taken a Review of his by paſt Life; as he was indeed a very ſerious Obſerver both of his own Life, and of the Paſſages of God's Providence about him,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51442:5"/>
yea and a recorder of both, though he did this in a Character at that time known to none but himſelf. And it is not improbable that his pains and labours upon this Subject through the Bleſſing of God, did contribute not a little to that weanedneſs from the World and all its vain Pleaſures and Delights, to which in agreat mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Author attained: And which did ſo notably fit and prepare him for his great Change, and made his paſſage from this Life to a better, ſweet, eaſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, that I remember I have ſeveral times heard that eminently worthy and Pious Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Gabriel Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> ſpeak of it both with delight and admiration.</p>
            <p>I do therefore perſwade my ſelf, Reader, that if thou be a perſon who wouldſt gladly have thy Heart weaned from the World, and be above the vain pleaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and have thy Converſation in Heaven, as a Stranger and Pilgrim in this Earth, the conſideration of this will have that influence upon thee, as to make thee carefully peruſe this piece, and look to the Lord for his Bleſſing therewith, that it may have the ſame effect with thee. I am ſure the Subject treated of, is not only uſeful, but highly neceſſary, eſpecially at ſuch a time, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all that is through the whole Scriptures, and particularly in the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> held forth of the <hi>vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> that is in all ſublunary Contentments and delights: And notwithſtanding of all the pains of the Lords Servants in their Expoſitions on the Scripture, and by Preaching, to Rivet this Truth upon the Hearts of Men: And notwithſtanding of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51442:6"/>
the Experiences and Convictions Men have of this Truth, by the many diſappointments they meet with from the Creatures: Yet ſo few have their Hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed to ſavour the things that are above: But on the contrary, many, alace! very many, proclaim as it were upon the Houſe tops, that <hi>their portion is in this Life,</hi> and that this World is their God. And as it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Spirit of God in the enditing of this Portion of Scripture, to take Men off from this, that they might not <hi>ſpend their Money for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which ſatisfieth not, nor digg up to themſelves broken Cisterns, that can hold no Water, nor weary themſelves as in the Fire for very Vanity; but ſet their affections upon the things above,</hi> and upon God himſelf as their all ſufficient Portion: So I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, the ſame was alſo the deſign of the Author of this Expoſition: And I am not without hope that through the Bleſſing of God, this may be as to ſome, the Fruits of his Labours therein.</p>
            <p>But beſide what thou haſt heard, that may make this Treatiſe acceptable to thee, from the Author himſelf, I muſt farther acquaint thee that this piece of his was both ſeen and approven as very worthy of the preſs by ſome Miniſters of great Eminency and Note. <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>James Ferguſſon,</hi> his next neighbour, and dear and intimat Brother, with whom he uſually communicat all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this kind, and who alſo did the like with him: And alſo Mr. <hi>Ralph Roger,</hi> two ſo great names, that they are above all Encomiums from me: And a third who is alſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51442:6"/>
of great Judgement and diſcerning in ſuch matters, but becauſe yet alive, I both forbear any farther commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of him, and alſo the mentioning of his name; who if he were not now at too great a diſtance, might have been fitter for this task than I.</p>
            <p>There is only one thing that may ſeem to plead againſt the neceſſity and expediency of this piece's coming to light at this time; which is, there are ſo many Learned, and elaborat Expoſitions and Commentaries upon this place of Scripture: As, <hi>Broughtoun, Cartwright, Beza Thomas Granger, Mihael Jermin, Joſeph Hall, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Thomſon, William Pemble, Thomas Pitt, John Cotton, Edward Leigh, Arthur Jackſon, Pools An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,</hi> and thoſe whom he makes uſe of in his <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and many otherforreign Divines of all perſwaſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former <hi>Engliſh Annotations,</hi> which if they had been as well done upon all the reſt of the Scripture, as upon it, might in my humble Judgement, have ſaved the Learned <hi>Pool,</hi> and his Continuators, the pains of emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their new Annotations.</p>
            <p>This part is ſo well done that it hath been thought worthy to be Printed a part by it ſelf, And indeed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be purchaſed by any who are not willing, or are not able to purchaſe all the reſt: For though the<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Heynolds.</hi>
               </note> Author was afterward a Biſhop, and I am no Friend to that office, as it hath been and ſtill is by ſome enhanced: yet this doth not weaken the eſteem I have for this and his other both Pious and Learned Works, eſpecially ſeing I underſtand that he never was a Perſecuter, but a perſon of great Moderation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51442:7"/>But to take off this Objection, let it be conſidered that the worthy and Reverend Author of this enſuing Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he had the benefite of moſt of all theſe expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo he had through the grace of God, the Judgement Sagacity, and Dexterity to chooſe out of them, what was moſt appoſite, and moſt conſiſtent with the Analogy of Faith; And even a Dwarf ſtanding upon the head of a Gyant, will ſee farther than the Gyant himſelf: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likwiſe, that the Lord hath given great Diverſities of Gifts to his Servants; and amongſt others, the gift and talent of Some lyes eſpecially in the Richneſs of their invention, Others in making more plain, and intelligible, the things which are invented by Others: And whether the Author had not his ſhare in both I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Judge upon peruſal, as likewiſe whether he had not conſiderable advantage beyond many, for opening Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from his rare skill in the original Languages, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Hebrew, wherein he greatly excelled. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it would be conſidered that the Authors Expoſition of this part of Scripture, as of the other he formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is in a way and method peculiar to himſelf with the reſt of his Countrey men, who went before him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is, plainly and ſuccinctly to open the words, and then to raiſe Practical Obſervations from them, and theſe for the moſt part, very comprehenſive, having oftentimes both Explanations, Cautions, and Reaſons, and ſometimes uſes couched under them. Laſtly let it be conſidered that the Scriptures of God, are ſo great a depth, that they cannot be exhauſted, and when many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51442:7"/>
have drawn, there is ſtill more for others to draw after them; And ſo Rich a Mine, that when many have digged, there are ſtill Pearles, and theſe precious Pearles to be found after them.</p>
            <p>Reader, If thou be one that haſt a real Hunger after thy Souls Food, thou wilt not caſt at it, becauſe it comes not to thee in a Lordly Diſh: but if otherwiſe: I ſhall make uſe of the words of a Learned Writter in the like caſe, and apply them to thee <hi>(If thy Stomach be nice and ſqueezie, and nothing will reliſh with thee, but what is ſpurce and elegant, there is store of ſuch Compoſures in the World, upon which thou mayeſt even ſurfeit thy curious fancy: in the mean time there will be found ſome who will bleſs God for what thou deſpiſeſt, and make many a ſweet Meal upon what thou loatheſt.</hi>

One that hath a Calling to aſſemble the Church, and declare the mind of GOD to Her: And ſo it agrees well to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as a Prophet. 2. One Reconciled. or Re-united to the Church, and thus alſo it agrees to him, who by his grievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Lord, had ſeparate himſelf from that Bleſſed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.5.9. Now being reſtored again he is <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> a penitent Soul, preaching his Repentance to the <hi>Church,</hi> the Word is of ſuch a Form, as neceſſarly requires ſomething of this kind to

be added to it for making it plain in our Language, and ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Original, we find the like added in the Tranſlation <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He deſcribes himſelf from his Parentage, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent according to the Fleſh, He is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> a Man in high eſteem with GOD, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.22. and with his <hi>Church,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23, 1: a Type of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Pſal:</hi> 89: 20. and his Progenitor according to the fleſh. <hi>Acts</hi> 13:23: <hi>Solomon</hi> doth deſign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, not to make any oſtentation of his Royal Birth but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiſe our minds to expect much good from him, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of many Prayers put up for him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fruit of a Holy Education, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.1. And many wholeſome counſels given him by his Father, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.2. And to call the Church to mind of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was known to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> by this ſtile, <hi>the Son of David, Mat.</hi> 22.42. compared with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.35, 36. and is now ſpeaking to the ſame in this Book by his Type. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He deſcribes himſelf from his civil place and Dignity, that he was a <hi>King;</hi> and ſo had many advantages, whereby he might abound in Knowledge; and a King in ſuch a place as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then the imperial Seat of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> afterward divided into two Kingdoms, the prime publick Reſidence of GOD in His Ordinances, with the only viſible Church He had in the World: And ſo he had many occaſions of being acquaint with the Wayes of GOD, with His Church and People. All which calls for Attention to the enſuing Purpoſe of this Book. Hence <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Whatever a publick Meſſenger of GOD may have to commend Him, and gain acceptance to His Meſſage; yet a Calling from GOD to Preach Truth in His Name, ought to be his chief incouragement to undertake any part of his imployment; and ſhould alſo add more weight to his Meſſage in the minds of People, than any conſideration of him they can have even though he were a <hi>King:</hi> For, <hi>Solomon</hi> before any other ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As theſe who have been very eminent for Office, Grace, and the like Qualifications, may (when the Lord is provock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to withdraw) fall into ſuch groſs Abominations, as might make them juſtly to be ſecluded from the Society of the Church: So when the Lord vouchſafes Repentance upon them, they will eſteem their Reconciliation with the Church a great benefit, and will be content to Preach their Sin, and ſorrow for Sin, that GOD may be honoured, and others wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Although deſcent from wicked or obſcure Parents, ought to be no juſt ground of prejudice againſt their Godly Children, who are by Faith ſerved Heirs to the Father of the Faithful <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, Yet deſcent from Godly Parents is ſuch an advantage to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Children as may be very comfortable to them, in ſo far as it cleareth their right to ſuch Promiſes as are made to the ſeed of the Upright. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37.26. And as it ought to be a ſtrong motive to them to imitate their Parents, and unto others alſo to accept the more heartily any meſſage that ſuch have from the Lord to them: For which cauſes, beſide others mentioned in the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> we may judge <hi>Solomon</hi> here to commend the purpoſe of this Book from this, that he was <hi>the Son of David.</hi> 4. The Lord hath ſeen it fit to imploy ſome of all ranks of Men to be the Preachers and Pen-men of His Holy Word, ſome obſcure perſons, as Herd-men, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. Fiſhers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4:8. and of other imployments, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.3.

The Greateſt on Earth ſhould think it no diſpiragement to them, nor inconſiſtent with the managing of the weightieſt civil Affairs to ſpend ſome of their time and pains in uſing all means competent for them in their place to propogate the knowledge of the Truth, and advance true Piety, this being the beſt policy they can uſe for eſtabliſhing their juſt power, and making People dutiful to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.12. For though <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote this Book as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Man; yet in his ſtudy to edifie the Church, and in his pains for acquiring much of that experimental knowledge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Church in it, he acted as an ordinary Man, and therein is a precedent to all, eſpecially Chriſtian Magiſtrates, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to improve their time and gifts by Writing, or other wayes, for the ſpiritual advantage of the Church and People of GOD, <hi>The words of the Preacher—King in Jeruſalem.</hi> 6. Although the Truth of GOD he worthy of all acceptation for its own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and uſefulneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119: 97, 98. even though it were delivered by Shepherds, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2: 17, 18. yet theſe whom the Lord imployes as his Embaſſadors to carry his mind to the Church, may make uſe of any external priviledge they have, to make way for the more hearty acceptance of their Meſſage among the People (who are hardly moved to receive the Truth upon more pure and ſpiritual conſiderations) providing the advantage of the Truth, and not their own Vain-glory be their end in ſo doing: For though <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s Calling to be a Preacher was alone ſufficient to gain accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to his Meſſage; yet to add the more weight unto it, he mentions alſo his Royal Birth and Dignity; and this in a modeſt may, omiting many other Titles of Honour, which vain-glorious Men for inferiour to him, delight to multiply to themſelves. <hi>The words of the Preacher, the Son of David, King in Jeruſalem.</hi>

And becauſe Men hear ſuch Doctrine oftentimes, as from Men only, and ſo eſteem it but vain words; therefore he mentions again his Calling to publiſh it to the World: and though Men will grant the truth of this aſſertion as to ſome things, yet deny it as to others; therefore he cloſes with this general, <hi>All is Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Now this Language of the Old Teſtament is the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with that of the New, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8. which doth fully clear this <hi>Doubtleſs I count all things loſs and dung, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Hence <hi>learn,</hi> 1. It is an excellent method of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sinners, Firſt, to convince, &amp; make them ſenſible of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs &amp; inſufficiency for Happineſs of theſe things which they purſue for ſatisfaction and contentment, &amp; ſo to make way for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to them what is only worthy to have their heart, time and pains ſpent upon it, conſidering that all Men are either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken in this matter, as to the taking up wherein their true Happineſs conſiſts, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 55.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3:3. or apprehenſive of the conſiſtency of their <hi>Idols,</hi> and fellowſhip with GOD, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. For this is the method the Spirit of GOD puts this excellent Preacher upon, before he point out wherein the chief Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and how the enjoyment thereof is attained: Firſt, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this Truth here aſſerted, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi> 2 It is neceſſary for a faithful Preacher (in the entry of his labour with the Lords People) to condeſcend upon, with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51442:12"/>
himſelf, and to propoſe to them ſome certain ſcope to be aimed at by him, to the clearing and uſe making whereof, his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpoſe may be directed, that ſo himſelf may be kept from extravagancy in diſcourſing, and peoples minds kept free of confuſion; both which are occaſioned by variety of purpoſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little or no evident dependance one upon another: For here <hi>Solomon</hi> in the entry doth condeſcend upon, and propoſe that which is one principal part of his ſcope in this Book, and as it were one Text which he is to explain, or one Doctrine which he is to prove and apply, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi> 3. Even theſe earthly and ſenſible delights which are in themſelves good, and in their right uſe lawful, and ſubſervient to Man for attaining true Happineſs, do prove altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and unſatisfactory to him, if he ſeek after the enjoyment of them, as his chief Good, in regard they have no proportion, nor ſutableneſs to the Soul of Man which is of a ſpiritual Nature, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.19. made capable of enjoying an infinite Good, GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to it through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as its Portion, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 73.25, 26. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 4. and ſo can never be ſatisfied with theſe fading and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things; for all temporary delights, mainly becauſe they are fading, and unable to ſatisfie the immortal Soul, are here pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi> 4: So tranſported are all Men naturally with the apprehenſion of Happineſs in things earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. and therefore ſo unwilling to hear and admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the contrary, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11. that thoſe who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the Vanity of theſe things and of the folly of their way in ſeeking Happineſs in them, had need to ſtudy a very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing ſtrain of dealing with their Hearers, to be very inſtant and frequent in inculcating upon them the baſeneſs and vanity of their Idols and ſinful courſes, and to lead up their minds to <hi>One</hi> higher than themſelves, in whoſe name they ſpeak: For <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking eſpecially to ſuch as are purſuing Happineſs in things earthly, uſeth here many Elegancies of Speech, not neceſſary to be particularly reckoned out, repeats often the Vanity of earthly

things, and minds his Hearers of his Calling to declare it unto the World, while he ſayeth <hi>vanity of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> 5. A true Penitent, who after he hath taſted the bitterneſs of his ſinful courſes, is brought to taſte the ſweetneſs of fellowſhip with GOD, will be no leſs affected with admiring the emptineſs and baſeneſs of created delights, and their unworthineſs to be choſen as a Mans portion, than he hath been formerly, with the apprehenſion of Happineſs and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be had in them; and ſuch an one will be a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to point out to others in a lively way the Vanity of theſe things whereby himſelf hath been ſo far diſappointed, and cannot but be very ſtrongly deſirous to have others perſwaded thereof: For theſe words flow from the ſenſe of penitent <hi>Solomons</hi> Heart, admiring his own madneſs in ſeeking Happineſs in ſo vain things as he had done, during the time of his eſtrangement from GOD, weighted with grief for his ſo doing, and earneſtly deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim other periſhing Sinners from ſuch vain courſes, as he had followed, and to allure them to come and Taſte of that Sweetneſs in fellowſhip with GOD, which he now enjoyed, while he thus cries out <hi>Vanity of Vanities, ſaith the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</hi>

                  <p>THis penitent Preacher cometh now to prove his former Aſſertion, anent the Vanity of all earthly Delights in order to the ſatisfaction, or making happy of the Soul of Man. His firſt Argument is taken from the unprofitableneſs or fruitleſneſs of mans pains about theſe things, and the more to rouze the Conſcience of them that apprehend no advantage but in things of that nature, he includes the Argument in a Queſtion, <hi>What Profit hath a Man,</hi> &amp;c. which hath the force of a Negation (as is clear the like queſtion hath in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.6.) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51442:13"/>
as much as if it had been ſaid, There is no true Profit at all, or, There is no real Advantage which may be truely called excellent, nor is there any abiding fruit of a Man's pains for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Happineſs or Contentment in theſe things (for the word in the Original which is tranſlated <hi>Profe,</hi> ſignifieth both that which is <hi>Excellent,</hi> and that which is <hi>Permanent</hi>) Now this is not to be underſtood as if Men had no real ſucceſs ſutable to their lawful pains about earthly things vouchſafed upon them, that were contrary to <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.23. but the meaning is, That there is no Profit conducing to the ſpiritual and eternal Happineſs of the Soul to be had by all that wicked labour, and toilſome pains (both which the word in the Original here tranſlated La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, doth ſignifie: For it is tranſlated <hi>Perverſneſs, Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Trouble, Pſal.</hi> 73.5. and <hi>Affliction, Pſal.</hi> 25.18.) which can he taken by any Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he is in his Natural eſtate, on in eſtrangement from GOD, as <hi>Solomon</hi> had been, who no doubt hath ſad Reflections upon his former ſinful courſe, while he thus ſpeaks for the Reclaiming of others. And this fruitleſneſs of a Mans Labour he doth reſtrict only to things under the Sun, that is, of an earthly and temporary concernment, on which Man ſpends his time and pains, which ſhould be employed about things above the Sun, or of a heavenly and eternal concernment, which are of a higher riſe and nature and ſo are expreſſed by things above. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. And as this Queſtion hath the force of a Denial, ſo hath it alſo of a ſtrong Aſſertion of the contrary, as the like Queſtion hath in Scripture, <hi>Gen,</hi> 37.26. and ſo it hath this alſo in the meaning of it, that there is unſpeakable Loſs and Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Men by all the pains they take about Things earthly, while they neglect to ſeek after Things that are above, and the force of it is fully cleared by that Queſtion of <hi>Chriſts, What ſhall it Profit a Man to gain the whole World and loſs his Soul?</hi> Mark 8.36. Hence <hi>Learn</hi> 1. However Men that ſeek their Portion in this Earth, may have abundance of outward ſucceſs of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. ond even more than their Hearts can wiſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

Nothing is to be eſteemed the true Profit of a Mans Labour of Body and Spirit, but that only which will abide, and continue with him, and therefore his Profit cannot in reaſon be thought to conſiſt in Earthly Pleaſures which are momentary, <hi>Job</hi> 26.5. nor in <hi>Riches which take Wings, Prov.</hi> 25, 5. nor in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory which <hi>deſcends not after him, Pſal:</hi> 49.17. but is only to be placed in fellowſhip with <hi>Christ,</hi> which may be in ſome meaſure continued with him along the courſe of his Pilgrimage here, <hi>Cant:</hi> 8.5. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 89.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 15.5. and ſhall never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted hereafter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. For, this expreſſion <hi>What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour?</hi> may be tranſlated, <hi>What is there abiding or remaining to Man of all his Labour?</hi> &amp;c. 3. While Men remain in an unrenewed ſtate, or being renewed, live in eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from GOD, they are ſo taken up with their preſent ſenſible ſatisfaction, eſteeming nothing elſe to afford them ſuch Profit or Pleaſure as they apprehend to find in their Idols, <hi>Gen:</hi> 25:32: <hi>Cant:</hi> 5:3: that they never put their own Hearts ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how fruitleſs their pains are in order to their true Bleſſedneſs, not how unſpeakably great their Loſs is by remaining in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereby they are holden faſt in it, till the Lord power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully change them, <hi>Iſai:</hi> 44:20. For, the Spirit's urging Mens Conſciences with this Queſtions, imports them utterly averſe from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51442:14"/>
pondering it till he put them to it. <hi>What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour wherein he laboureth?</hi> 4. It is the ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the unprofitableneſs of Mens Labour about Things earthly, as to the making of them truly happie, and of the unſpeakable Loſs they ſuſtain by their purſuing theſe things, neglecting in the mean time the ſtudy of Reconciliation and fellowſhip with GOD, which the Lord uſeth to bleſs, for reclaiming Sinners from their evil wayes, and for continuing and increaſing a penitent frame of Spirit in them that are reclaimed: For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> repreſents both theſe in this queſtion that he may reclaim Sinners from following lying Vanities, ſo doubtleſs he doth thereby renew in his own heart the exerciſe of Repentance, for his own former folly, <hi>What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour wherein he laboureth.</hi> 5. What ever be the kind of Labour that Men unrenewed, or eſtranged from GOD can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves in, whether it be about Civil or Religious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the ſame is all alike unprofitable to them, as to the bringing about of any true Happineſs or Contentment to them, and is both their Sin and their Miſery, though they change their Labour never ſo oft, they can never find any Profit in it, their <hi>Plowing is Sin, Prov.</hi> 21, 4. and ſo is <hi>their Praying, Prov:</hi> 28.9. And therefore all will increaſe their miſery: For this word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their pains of what ſort ſoever are ſet forth ſignifies Perverſe or wicked Labour, weariſome, and ſpending Toil and Travel. <hi>What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour which he taketh under the Sun?</hi> 6. There is no queſtion to be made of excellent Advantage, and abiding Fruit to be had of that Labour which GOD's ſpecial Grace enables Men to take about things that are above the Sun, ſuch as the Favour of GOD, and everlaſting Bleſſedneſs: For, the queſtion is only, <hi>What Profit hath a Man of all the Labour he takes under the Sun?</hi>

                  <p>THe ſecond Argument to prove the Vanity of Things earthly, and to wean the Hearts of Men from ſeeking Happineſs in them, is here taken from the frail, and fading condition of man, who cannot abide long to enjoy theſe things, though there were ſome Profit in them, which he denied in the former Verſe, and therefore they muſt be vain in order to his chief Happineſs. And this he <hi>First</hi> aſſerts, while he ſaith, <hi>One Generation cometh, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeth:</hi> By <hi>one Generation</hi> he means the whole company of Men and Women living together at one time, as the word ſignifies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12, 7. By the <hi>paſſing away of one Generation and the coming of another</hi> is meant, that all the Men now living are in a continual motion, departing away from their earthly Enjoyments, and that there is another Company coming up in their place to poſſeſs the ſame, and then to leave them to others again as the former did; ſo that none of them can long enjoy theſe things. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He doth illuſtrat this frail, and tranſitory condition of Man, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the more permanent condition of other Creatures, of which he giveth four Inſtances, with every one whereof Mans frailty is to be compared, that it may take the deeper impreſſion. The <hi>first</hi> is of the <hi>Earth The Earth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>abideth for ever,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if this World were eternal, as <hi>Atheiſts</hi> deſire. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. For the Scripture is clear to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Mat</hi> 24.35. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. But it is ſaid to abide for ever becauſe it ſhall remain fixed for a long time, as the Original word tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>for ever</hi> doth often ſignifie in Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13. even ſo long as time laſts, that it may be an abiding Stage, for Generations to go and come upon which duration of the Earth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51442:15"/>
is a kind of Eternity in compariſon of Mans ſhort abode upon it, the conſideration whereof may ſerve to diſwade Man from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Happineſs in the Earth: For, however the Earth abideth very long; yet Mans abode upon the Earth is very ſhort. v. 4: The <hi>ſecond Instance</hi> to illuſtrat this frailty of Man, is of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who keeps a conſtant, orderly, and ſwift motion, toward the place of his riſing and ſetting, and he is ſaid <hi>to haſte toward</hi> (or <hi>pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> as the word ſignifies) the Orient or <hi>place of his riſing,</hi> becauſe however his motion be no leſs ſwift toward the Occident, or place of his ſetting; yet his riſing is moſt deſired, and remarked by Men, but as for Man when he is once gone down to Death, he ſhall riſe no more to the enjoyment of his earthly Contentments, <hi>Job</hi> 14.7.12, and therefore theſe are not to be ſought after as his chief Happineſs. <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. The <hi>third Inſtance</hi> for the clearing the ſame purpoſe, is of the <hi>Winds,</hi> whoſe motions, although to us they are moſt uncertain, yet in all their changes they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerve their <hi>Circuits or Rounds</hi> which are appointed them by him who <hi>bringeth them out of his Treaſures, Pſal.</hi> 135.7. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all their motions at his pleaſure, <hi>Job</hi> 37, 12. And in ſome places of the World, makes them to keep ſuch an uniform courſe, as Men may know whence they will blow at ſuch and ſuch Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But as for frail and unconſtant Man, he is like a Wind that paſſeth away and returneth not again to his place in the World, <hi>Job</hi> 7.7, 10. <hi>Pſ:</hi> 78.37. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. The <hi>fourth Inſtance</hi> is of the <hi>Waters</hi> which keep their conſtant courſe, the Rivers runing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sea, and yet the Sea never full, becauſe the Waters are either drawn up thence into Vapours, and Clouds, to diſtill down upon the Earth, to water it, and fill the Rivers again, or elſe conveyed throw ſecret paſſages of the Earth, and Rocks to the Fountains and Lakes whence Rivers do ariſe; but as for frail Man he is carried away as with a Flood, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 90.5. and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again to the enjoyment of his earthly Contentments. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. Now that which is here ſpoken of the permanency of the Earth, and conſtancy of other Creatures in their motions, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51442:15"/>
of them in their ordinary courſe; For the Lord hath given proof of his Soveraignity in changing their courſe, making the Earth to tremble, <hi>Job</hi> 9, 6. the Sun to ſtand ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12. and go back in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, <hi>Iſai:</hi> 38, 8. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to run backward from the Sea, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 114, 5. and the Winds to blow as it were out of all Arts at once, <hi>Job</hi> 1, 19. And howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many excellent and uſeful Obſervations concerning the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and other Properties of GOD, may be drawn from all theſe Inſtances, conſidered in themſelves, and by the help of other Scriptures where they are made uſe of as from the firmneſs of the Earth eſtabliſhed upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 26.27. to admire the marvelous power of GOD, and be helped thereby to believe the moſt unlikely thing that he hath promiſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45, 18: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the conſtant motion of that glorious Lamp of Heaven the <hi>Sun,</hi> to be helped to believe the conſtant faithfulneſs of GOD in keeping the promiſes of his Covenant to his People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 33, 36. and 33.10. his Bounty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.11. and his ſpeedy helping his People in ſtraits, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. And from his ordering the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Winds and Waters, to be moved to believe how eaſie it is with him to reſtrain and puniſh his Enemies; <hi>Pſ.</hi> 65.7. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.6. yet theſe things are not to be here conſidered as intended in theſe Inſtances, which are only brought in to illuſtrate Mans frail and fading Condition, as being much more vain, uncertain, and inconſtant, than that of the reſt of the Creatures, and we may be the more confirmed that this is the intent of the LORDS Spirit, in ſetting down theſe Inſtances by conſidering that the Scripture doth frequently illuſtrate Mans frailty by theſe and the like ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes. <hi>Job</hi> 14.7, 10. and 16.22. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men and Women that are upon the face of the Earth, are in a continual motion toward Death and Eternity, whatever they be doing, their courſe that way is never interrupted: And therefore as every Man in particular ſhould look upon himſelf as being ſhortly to bid fare-well to all his earthly Contentments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to meet with them again, that thereby his heart may be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51442:16"/>
weaned from delighting in them as his Portion, that he may be moved to ſeek after that which will abide with him when he is gone out of this World, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12, 23. And in ſo doing may have true Comfort, conſidering that neither his Sufferings in this World can be long, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.17. nor his Combat with his ſpiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 20, nor ſhall he be long holden from the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Bleſſedneſs: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. So likewayes ſhould every one look upon another as paſſing away, whether they be his neareſt Friends or Relations in whom he hath moſt comfort, that he may not idolize them, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 7: 31. or his Enemies that he may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther envy their proſperity, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37.2. nor by fear of them be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his Duty, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.12, 13. ſeing himſelf and they alſo ſhall ſo ſoon paſs away. For to convince Men of the Vanity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of all earthly Delights in order to their true Happineſs, the Spirit of the LORD doth here by a word of the preſent time repreſent the whole company of Men that live together at any one time upon the Earth as in a continual motion, travelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to another place, to make way for others who are to come up in their ſtead, <hi>One Generation paſſeth away and another cometh.</hi> 2. There will be a continual ſucceſſion of one Generation to another while the Earth and Time doth laſt, that CHRIST may alwayes have a Bride, and a Seed to ſerve him in the World, the thoughts whereof, as they ſhould move every Man ſo to ſerve his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as he may profit the ſucceeding, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 145.4. ſo ſhould they ſtrongly divert him from purſuing the tranſitory Vanities of this Earth as his Portion and Happineſs, that ſo he may not leave behind him the effects and memory of his Vanity, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be an occaſion of Sin, or matter of Grief to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation: For as an Argument to perſwade Men of the Vanity of earthly Delights, that ſo their hearts may be weaned from them, is this aſſerted that when <hi>one Generation paſſeth away another cometh.</hi> 3. So raviſhed are Men naturally with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent earthly Enjoyments, ſo forgetful of their Mortality, and the time of their parting with them, and ſo dull in the apprehenſion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51442:16"/>
of ſuch things when they are pointed out to them, that they have need of many Remembrancers thereof, and of much pains to be taken upon them, to ſtamp their hearts with ſerious Thoughts of the ſame; and ſo gracious is the Lord, that he vouchſafes all this upon them, as appears by his inſtructing them here (and elſe where in his Word) how to read profitable Leſſons of this ſort u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> which have more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency and conſtancy, than vain Man who ſeeks his Happineſs in a momentany enjoyment of Things here. <hi>The Earth abides for ever, the Sun ariſeth and goeth down, and the Windes whirle aboue continually, the Rivers run into the Sea, and thence return to the place whence they came,</hi> all which are here reckoned out to teach Man his frailty, and to illuſtrat to him his inconſtant and fading conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſſerted in the firſt place, <hi>One Generation paſſeth away and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh.</hi> 4. The whole Creation keepeth that conſtant courſe of Obedience to their Maker wherein he ſet them at the firſt, and will continue ſo doing till he looſe them from their work, ſo that Man cannot look any where among the Creatures, but he ſhall ſee them at their duty, except when he abuſeth them, as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Inclination, violently forcing them to ſerve him in his ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.22. This ſhould convince him of his ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while he beholds all the Creatures ſo ſpeedy and conſtant without wearying at their duty, and himſelf ſo fickle in what is good, ſo frequently out of his duty, and acting contrary to the Law given him, and the ſtrength and Grace allowed upon him: For, here the four principal parts of the World are brought in conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their duty, to illuſtrat Mans Vanity who forgets his Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo hardneth himſelf in the purſute of vain Things which he cannot long enjoy as his Portion. <hi>One Generation paſſeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the Earth abides for ever. The Sun alſo,</hi> &amp;c. 5. So ſpiritual a frame of heart ſhould a Child of GOD intertain, that he ſhould be ſtill making ſome ſpiritual uſe of theſe viſible things which do moſt commonly offer themſelves unto his view, and particularly ſo mindful ſhould he be of his Mortality, and the frailty of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51442:17"/>
earthly condition, that he ſhould not only read the ſame upon theſe creatures which are more fading, and offer themſelves to his view only at certain Seaſons, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10, 11. But alſo upon theſe that are more permanent than himſelf, and offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves continually to his conſideration, for, ſo doth the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> here teach Man, by this Divine Preacher to make a Spiritual uſe of, and particularly to mind his Mortality and Frailty, by this, that the Duſt he treds upon is more durable than he, the <hi>Sun, Winde</hi> and <hi>Waters</hi> are more conſtant in their courſe than he.</p>

                  <p>THis Verſe contains two further <hi>Arguments</hi> to convince Men of the Inſufficiency of all earthly Delights to make them truely Happy; and ſo to prove them vain who ſeek Happineſs in them: <hi>The one is,</hi> that all theſe Earthly Things being ſought after as a mans chief good, <hi>are full of Labour,</hi> to wit, to the man that labours about them, he finds nothing by them but Toil and Wearineſs, which ſpends him and makes him faint, as the word ſignifies; and this ſpending labour is ſo great, that neither he that takes it, nor any other can ſufficiently expreſs it. The <hi>other Argument</hi> is, that theſe things about which man doth thus labour, when they are enjoyed by him ſo far as can be, do yeild him no true ſatisfaction at all, which might compenſe his weariſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in ſeeking after them; and this unſatisfaction he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in two of the outward Senſes, whoſe Objects are moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and delectable of any other, and yet they remain ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied: Now theſe two are put for all the Senſes, and the Senſes are ordinarily in Scripture put for the Faculties of the Soul; eſpecially the Deſires and Delights thereof. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 25.15. 1 <hi>Joh:</hi> 2 16. Which can never be ſatisfied with any earthly thing. And if we joyntly conſider the Preachers two former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51442:17"/>
                     <hi>to wit,</hi> that there is no true profit in theſe earthly things, and that man hath but a ſhort abode with them, together with the two here made uſe of, Namely, That it coſts a man unſpeakable Toil and Wearineſs <hi>in Labour,</hi> before he attain to theſe things, and when he hath attained them ſo far as is poſſible, they yeild him no <hi>True ſatisfaction;</hi> we cannot but aſſent to that which he aſſerted in the entry to be proven, that all earthly things are <hi>Vanity</hi> in order to the making of Man Happy, and Man is vain in ſeeking Happineſs in them, neglecting the Study of reconciliation &amp; Fellowſhip with God, and of living in his Fear and Obedience for intertaining that Fellowſhip. And the ſubſtance of both theſe Arguments contained in this Verſe, is plainly held forth by the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> expoſtulating with his people by <hi>Iſa.</hi> ch: 55.2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men that ſeek their Happineſs in any created things whatſoever, ſhall meet with nothing in them, or in their endeavours about them, but exceeding great Toil, and ſo much Wearineſs to Holy and Spirit, as all the comfort they can reap by theſe things, ſhall not be able to compenſe, the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo diſpoſing, that this <hi>ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Labour</hi> of Man may be an Admonition to all of their Folly, in ſeeking Happineſs in theſe things; a powerful Motive to ſome to change their way, and ſeek their Happineſs where the word diſcovers it to be, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 55.2. <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>Joh:</hi> 17.3. <hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 12.13. And to others who will not do ſo, a juſt Correction of their Perverſeneſs, and an earneſt of their endleſs vexation: For here the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> ſhews expreſly what the man that ſeeks after any created thing as his chief Good, ſhall find for his ſo doing, <hi>All things are full of Labour.</hi> 2. Such is the natural perverſeneſs of every mans Heart, before the <hi>Lord</hi> make a change upon him, that though he cannot be moved to take the leaſt pains for his Souls Happineſs, <hi>Prov:</hi> 6.10. (the advantage and ſweetneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is unſpeakable 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.) But doth eſteem the eaſieſt and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Duties of Religion intollerably painful, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. Yet will he ſpend and waſte himſelf in purſuing periſhing Trifles, by ſo much toilſome Labour, as neither himſelf nor any other can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51442:18"/>
expreſs, for ſo ſaith the Spirit of God here, ſpeaking of that painful Labour which men take about earthly things, <hi>Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter it.</hi> 3. However natural Men while they are purſuing after Earthly Contentments as their chief Good, do fooliſhly imagine, that if they had ſome further meaſure of them, they would then be ſatified. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12, 18, 19. Yet ſuch is the curſe which the Lord hath put upon all Earthly things ſought after as a Mans beſt portion, that his unſatisfaction after attainment of them, is no leſs then it was in the purſuit, but rather ſtill grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Thirſt doth in ſome Diſtempered Perſons, by Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Till loſt Man cloſe with God reconciling himſelf to him in Chriſt, till he in ſome Meaſure by Faith ſee him reconciled, and hear the joyful ſound of his Spirit, ſpeaking pardon and Peace through the promiſes, had he never ſo great plenty of ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, in themſelves never ſo raviſhing, this may ſtill be truly ſaid of him, <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</hi> 4. All the toil and weariſome Labour that unrenewed Men have in purſuing Lying Vanities and all the unſatisfaction, and Loathing, they have in the enjoyment of them, doeth never a whit divert them from ſpending themſelves yet further, in the purſuit of ſuch things, till once the Lord let them ſee better things worthy of their Spirit and pains, and incline their Hearts to purſue theſe: for here the Spirit of the Lord ſets forth every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Man, as it were ſtill Gazing upon <hi>unſatisfying</hi> Objects, and ſtill harkening greedily to the voice of Satans Temptations, and his own corruption perſwading him, that there is Happineſs to be found in theſe things. Although he find unſpeakable weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Labour in his pains about them, yet he ſtill Labours that way, and his Eyes and Ears are bent upon them, though it be thus with him, <hi>his Eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor his Ear filled with hearing,</hi>

                  <p>THeſe words contain the <hi>fifth Argument</hi> to prove that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be had in things Earthly, and therefore that mans endeavours to find it in them muſt be Vain, the force of it is, that as all who have formerly ſought after contentment in the Creatures, neglecting the Study of Reconciliation and Fellowſhip with God have met with nothing but much Toil and Vexation without any true ſatisfaction, as hath been ſhown in the former verſe, ſo is it the conſtant Determination of God, that it ſhall fare the ſame way, with all that ſhall try the ſame courſe, neither ſhall any now living, or that are to live afterward, find any new thing in theſe earthly delights. Both the Idols whith men can purſue, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here, <hi>the thing that hath been</hi>) and the Courſes they can take for attaining to them (called, <hi>that which is done</hi>) being the ſame for Subſtance, with theſe which have been before. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And the more to convince men hereof, He puts it to the Conſcience of every one to condeſcend (if they can) upon an inſtance to the contrary, while he ſaith, <hi>is there any thing whereof it can be ſaid, See, this is New?</hi> Importing it impoſſible to ſhow any ſuch thing: and becauſe every man ſeeking his Happineſs in this Earth, is ſtrongly Apprehenſive of better ſucceſs in his way, than theſe have had who lived before him, the Preacher doth again aſſert the contrary in the cloſe of <hi>ver:</hi> 10. So that his denying any thing to be new under the Sun, and affirming that whatever is now hath been already, is not to be underſtood of things Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, ſuch as are the new Works of God in the ſecond Creation, about the Converſion of Sinners, which are all new. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5, 17. Nor of the Mercies of the Lord daily renewed to his own <hi>Lam:</hi> 3.22, Which though they be the ſame for kind and ſubſtance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51442:19"/>
with what have been before, yet have they ſtill a new Reliſh and Raviſhing ſweetneſs to the Souls of his People. <hi>Pſ:</hi> 20.3. As if they had never been before. Nor is this to be underſtood, as if there were not new wayes of Diſhonouring God daily invented by Satan, and mens Corruption, <hi>Judg:</hi> 5.8. and new Aggravations of mens Sins daily multiplying. <hi>Jer:</hi> 2.10, 11. &amp;c. Neither yet as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had thought that there were not after his time many new and ſtrange things to fall forth in the future diſpenſations of Gods Grace and Providence. <hi>Jer:</hi> 31.22. Nor can the expreſſion be underſtood, of lawfull Arts whereof ſome had been newly invented before <hi>Solomons</hi> time. <hi>Gen:</hi> 4, 21, 22. and others have been for the great advantage of humane Society found out ſince his time, as experience ſhowes. But thir expreſſions are to be underſtood according to the Scope, and ſubject matter in hand: As. 1. That there is no new earthly delight to be found out by man, beſide one of theſe three Idols, <hi>Pleaſure, Profit</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> which the men of this World have always ſince the beginning been Worſhiping. Nor 2. Any new courſe to be found out for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, the like whereof for ſubſtance, and no leſs effectual for the end, hath not been eſſayed before, of both which the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er giveth inſtances afterward. Nor. 3. Any new ſucceſs of theſe courſes to be expected, but the ſame diſapointment and vexation of Spirit, which men have found of old in purſuing theſe ſame Idols after the ſame manner, whereof he ſpake in the former verſe. And this <hi>Argument</hi> to reclaim vain Man from his ſinfull courſes is the ſame in ſubſtance, with that which the Lord by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets frequently makes uſe of with his People, taken from the diſappointment and vexation their Fathers had found, to deter their Children from their Profane and Idolatrous courſes. <hi>Jer:</hi> 16, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

conceit of their own Wit for effectuating their woful deſigns, as if they had found or could yet find out new ways of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Idols, and could make their contentment in things Earthly ſo full as never any did before, nor ſhall eaſily do after them; for, the words may be ſafely taken for a refutation of ſuch imaginations in Men who as it were think the former ages have been ſhort ſighted in the matter of finding out Happineſs in things Earthly, and that now they will eaſily find out new and more excellent delights, and new and more effectual wayes of attaining to them, in all which they are here by the Spirit of God contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while he ſaith, <hi>The thing that hath been it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi> 2.

This Oblivion of Men and their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the <hi>Lord</hi> threatens as a puniſhment of their forgetting things neceſſary for his Glory and their Souls Good, and of their imagining Happineſs in ſo vain a thing, as other Mens remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them and their Actions after they are gone, ſhould wean their Hearts from Earthly Contentments as their portion, and make them Study by all means to be of the number of them whoſe Memory is Bleſſed. <hi>Prov:</hi> 10 7. And who ſhall be with God and His Saints, in Everlaſting <hi>Remembrance. Pſ:</hi> 112.6. For, As an Argument toward this Scope, is this here brought in. <hi>There is no Remembrance of former things, neither ſhall there be any Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of things that are to come, with thoſe that ſhall come after.</hi> 5. Let Men weary themſelves never ſo much in going from one thing to another ſeeking after an Earthly Happineſs, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath determined to blaſt all their Enterpriſes, and to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them in every courſe they can take for their ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Study of Reconciliation with himſelf, and living in his Fear and Obedience; for after he hath diſappointed them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their Life, of deſired ſatisfaction in their ſeveral Idols, as is expreſſed in the former Words, he declares here, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves alſo to cut off that which they imagined to have after Death. <hi>There is no Remembrance of former things, neither ſhall there be any Remembrance of things that are to come.</hi> 6. If Man did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the former Courſes that others have taken for attaining ſatisfaction in things Earthly together with the ſad diſſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that <hi>God</hi> hath made them to meet with in their way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may be kept in Remembrance, by the Study of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Obſervation of Providences, they might thereby be keept from looking upon any Earthly delight, they can propoſe to ſeek, as if it were new, and from imagining to fall upon any new courſe which may prove more ſucceſsful for attaining to it,

                  <p>HEre is the <hi>Seventh Argument,</hi> taken from the Preachers own Experience, the ſum of it is, that after his moſt painful and Serious Study, to ſee the utmoſt that Mans wit could attain unto, for the bringing about of any Happineſs or true contentment to him, while his affections are not ſet upon things which are above, he had found by Experience that all comes to nothing but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and Vexation. And that this Argument from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may be the more forceable, he doth firſt, hold out ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſiderations of himſelf and his Study, to add weight unto it. As. 1. That he was advanced both to Eccleſiaſtick and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Dignity, and that over the People who were the only Church
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51442:21"/>
that God had in the World, and ſo was not only obliged to this Study, that he might profit the Church, he being called to be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> but ſingularly fitted with many Advantages for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering himſelf in his Studies, he being <hi>a King,</hi> and that in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Verſe 12.2. That this Study of his was not by conſtraint, but that his Heart was applyed and ſtrongly inclined to it, <hi>He gave his Heart unto it.</hi> 3. That his inclination was followed with Variety of pains, one degree of diligence being added to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the uſe of all means for attaining to clearneſs in this great queſtion wherein true Happineſs doth conſiſt, <hi>he gave his Heart to ſeek and ſearch.</hi> 4. That this his Study was guided and ordered by that habitual Wiſdome which God had given to him in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meaſure, above all other Men. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29. 5. That in this acurate enquiry of his, none of the Creatures, or Works of God about them, that might in his apprehenſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing for making Man Happy, had eſcaped his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. And next he doth hold forth two Experimental Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of his, as the reſult of this his moſt painful and acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Study. 1. That this painful and Laborious way of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any meaſure of right and ſound knowledge, is impoſed by the Lord upon Man to be a humbling Exerciſe to him, as the Word tranſlated <hi>Sore travel</hi> ſignifies, the more to convince him of his natural Miſery. <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. 2. That upon a ſerious Survey of all theſe Works of God which he had been Studying, he had found that Man, Living out of Fellowſhip with God, can find nothing by them but diſappointment, or emptineſs of ſatisfaction which is <hi>Vanity,</hi> and a gnawing of his Conſcience, or feeding of his Soul upon the Winde which is the <hi>Vexation</hi> of Spirit here ſpoken of. <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. As for the time when <hi>Solomon</hi> hath been Exerciſed in in this painful Study here ſpoken of, it may be either referred to the time of his defection, and eſtrangment from God, when he was imploying his wit (which even then remained with him <hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 2.9.) to the utmoſt for finding out an Happineſs, beſide fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, and ſo it makes to his propoſed ſcope, ſeeing he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51442:21"/>
is now a penitent ſadly reflecting, and at direction of the Spirit of God, paſſing ſentence upon his former follyes: Or this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Study of his, may be referred to the time of his nearneſs to God, whether before his defection, or after his recovery from it, and ſo the purpoſe agrees no leſs to the ſame Scope, conſidering that his end in that Study, was to ſee what Mans wit could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, in or about the Creatures, for making him truly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that ſo he might the more effectually convince his own, and the Hearts of others, of <hi>Vanity</hi> in ſeeking Happineſs that way. Beſide what was obſerved from <hi>Solomons</hi> deſcription of himſelf <hi>verſe.</hi> 1, We may hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. The eminency of a Mans place and Employment whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil, as alſo the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and priviledges of the People over whom he hath Charge; ſhould be ſo far from making him ſlack and negligent in pains for bettering of his Gifts, as if his meaſure of theſe were ſufficient already, ſeeing he is ſo employed; that on the contrary, the conſideration thereof ſhould ſtir him up to the greater pains and diligence, that he may Grow in Abilities, for the more faithful and ſucceſſful diſcharge of his Employment, for, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Solomons</hi> Office in the Church and State of <hi>Jſrael</hi> may be looked upon as here mentioned by him, as a ſpecial motive to that exceeding great Diligence afterward deſcribed, I <hi>the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was King over</hi> Iſrael <hi>in</hi> Jeruſalem. 2: As theſe who have a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to point out the way of Life and Bleſſedneſs to others, and to diſſwade them from following Lying Vanities, ſhould Labour for the Experimental knowledge, and feeling of the Power of the truths they deliver themſelves, that with the greater affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confidence, they may ſpeak them to others; ſo when the Lord ſends Preachers who may in Charity be Judged to ſpeak from their own experience, People may take advantage of the conſideration of the Meſſenger, to move their own Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth, with a ſpecial meaſure of attention and reverence; for, here <hi>Solomon</hi> draws an Argument to gain weight to the truth from his own Experience who Preached it. <hi>I the Preacher
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51442:22"/>
gave my Heart to ſeek and ſearch out by Wiſdom.</hi> &amp;c. 3. Although theſe extraordinary, and Infallibly aſſiſted Men who Wrote the Scripture, had much of the minde of God revealed to them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and without their pains and Study for acquiring the knowledge thereof. 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.21. yet were they not exeemed from ordinary pains, but rather called to more than ordinary Diligence, for further clearing to themſelves, and confirming of their own hearts in the Faith and Experimental knowledge of theſe truths, ſo immediatly revealed, and for acquiring the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other truths, ſee. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 10. Which both warrants and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ordinary Miniſters, not to ſpare their pains, for profiting in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and edifiying the Church of God; for even this extraordinary man, <hi>Preacher and King in Jeruſalem, gave away his heart, to ſeek and to ſearch by wiſdom.</hi> 4. The Lords People ſhould be ſo far from diſapproving the pains, and ſtudy of Miniſters, or diſliking the meſſage which by much labour and premeditation, is fitted for them, as <hi>Enthuſiasts</hi> do, ſuch pains being commanded, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.16. and having the promiſe of a Bleſſing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. that by the contrary theſe <hi>Leſſons</hi> which are the fruit and reſult of much ſerious diligence in the Preacher, ſhould be received with the more attention and acceptation by the Hearers: For, ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here commend the Purpoſe in hand, and labour to gain Attention and Reſpect to it by this, that it had coſt him ſo much pains and ſtudy in the acquiring of it. I <hi>gave my heart to ſeek and ſearch out by wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. 5. They that would grow in that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which may be profitable for their own Souls muſt give their Hearts away to the ſtudy of it, by diverting their minds frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from other Studies, and labouring to get their Hearts in love with that knowledge they aim at, as conducing to their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſo will the whole Man concur in the ſtudy to which the Heart is applied, Pains will be ſweetned, and Succeſs will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2. &amp;c. for this courſe did <hi>Solomon</hi> take, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>gave my heart</hi> ſaith he) <hi>to ſeek</hi> &amp;c. 6. For attaining to that knowledge which may be profitable for the Saving of a Mans Soul, there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51442:22"/>
muſt be variety of means uſed, ſuch as bending of the Wit in ſearching of the Scriptures and meditating upon them, Prayer to God, and uſe making of all the helps we can have from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for encreaſe of our knowledge, adding one degree of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to another, even when after many Eſſayes there remains unſatisfaction with the meaſure attained, and the whole courſe of a Mans ſtudy in the uſe of theſe means muſt he ſo ordered, as his imploying of divine Help, and conſulting of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> may ordinarly go before the uſe of other means: For, the former of theſe two words here uſed to expreſs <hi>Solomon</hi>'s pains in <hi>Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſignifies a Mans own <hi>ſecret Diligence,</hi> which is eſpecially <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> the other ſignifies to ask the <hi>help of others,</hi> and likewiſe an orderly diſpoſing of his pains in his Study. <hi>I gave my heart to ſeek, and to ſearch out,</hi> &amp;c. 7. As the Lord doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow at once, all that meaſure of true and ſound knowledge, which he intends to give to his Children, but lets it out by little and little, ſo one degree or meaſure of the ſame is the beſt guide to direct a Man in ſeeking after more of it, in ſo much as none can move to any good purpoſe in the ſtudy thereof, till they be firſt prevented with the free gift of ſome meaſure of that knowledge, it being that only which makes them capable of further, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and ſets them upon the fitteſt means of attaining thereto, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. For, here it is clear, that <hi>Solomon</hi> had one degree of his Wiſdom before another, and that the Former was his guide in ſeeking after the Latter. <hi>I gave my heart to ſeek and to ſearch out by wiſdom.</hi> 8. The greater meaſure of knowledge any attain unto, they will be the more deſireous of more, the more acurate, and ſerious will their ſearch be, and the greater their pains after a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſure thereof: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> did not ſatisfie himſelf with that very meaſure which God gave him 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. <hi>But gave his heart to ſeek and ſearch one by wiſdom.</hi> 9. There is nothing which God hath made, or doth, neither any thing which he ordereth, or permitteth to be done, but it deſerveth Mans ſerious thoughts, as that from whence he may learn ſomething for his profit: the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51442:23"/>
ſtudy of the Creatures will not only inſtruct him what is for the preſerving, or recovering of his natural health, but alſo proclaim to him the glorious Properties of his Maker. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. The ſtudy of humane Affairs may teach him what is for the advantage of his worldly Eſtate, yea even the greateſt miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the World may afford him either matter of caution to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the like, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 6. or of Praiſe that Men are reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from miſcarrying further, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 76.10: or of Comfort that God is bringing good of it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.7, 12. For, <hi>Solomon</hi> did give his heart <hi>to ſeek and ſearch out by wiſdom, concerning all things that are done under the Sun.</hi> 10. That the Children of the Lord may be the better content with their Portion, the more taken up with their Happineſs in fellowſhip with him, and may be the more able to convince others of their folly and madneſs in ſeeking Happineſs elſewhere, they may lay out their wit ſometimes in conſidering what Happineſs, the Creatures and humane Endeavours about them can yeild, ſtill putting the ſame in the Ballance with what is to be had in Communion with the Lord, that ſo comparing <hi>Christ</hi> the true Apple-tree, with the Trees of the Wood, <hi>His Fruit may be the ſweeter to their taſte,</hi> and comparing the excellent knowledge of him, with what may be known and injoyed of other things, theſe other things may become <hi>Droſs</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> in their eſteem: For, we may ſafely conſider <hi>Solomon</hi> here expreſſing himſelf to have laid out his Wit and Pains to ſee what Happineſs is to be had in the Creatures, that ſo he might the more heartily cleave unto that <hi>better Part</hi> which he had <hi>choſen,</hi> and the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince all others of their folly in <hi>troubling themſelves about many other things. I gave my heart to ſeek and to ſearch out concerning all things under the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. And behold <hi>All is Vanity,</hi> to wit, in compariſon of that ſolid Happineſs which is in fellowſhip with the Lord. 11. Fallen Man cannot recover the leaſt degree of his loſt Perfection, without exceeding great toil and labour, and this the Lord hath impoſed upon him to make him the more ſenſible of the greatneſs of that Ruine that is come upon him, eſpecially
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51442:23"/>
his underſtanding by the Fall <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. to correct him for his folly, in imploying his wit about things needleſs or ſinful, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10, 41. and to make him long for that ſtate wherein the ſtudy of things truly Excellent ſhall be his delight and ſatisfaction. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.15 For, now the ſtudy of Knowledge is <hi>a ſore travel which God hath given to, or impoſed upon the Sons of Men.</hi> 12. Whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Man finds pain and travel in ſeeking after the knowledge of theſe things which he is called to ſtudy, he ſhould mind what is Gods great End in ſo diſpoſing, even to exerciſe him by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to humble wreſtling with himſelf in Faſting and Prayer, for ſo the word ſometimes ſignifies, <hi>Est.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10 12. As the beſt way for him to be rid of Anxiety, while his Study is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and his Succeſs ſeems ſmall, and ſo to work his Heart to ſubmiſſion as the ſame word is rendred <hi>Gen.</hi> 16 9 and ſo likewayes to fit him for Gods anſwering of his pains, which is alſo in the ſignification of the word <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.21. with a further degree of light, as the fruit and bleſſing of his pains, and ſtir him up to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Lord with thankfulneſs for any meaſure of aſſiſtance he hath: For, ſaith he, <hi>this ſore travel hath God given to the Sons of Men to be exerciſed,</hi> or to be humbled thereby or anſwered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: 13. However Man looking only upon a part of the works that are done under the Sun, (as for example, his own proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, and imaginary delights, and not upon the miſeries incident to him, and the Lords frequent croſſing and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in his deſignes) he may have golden Dreams of ſome piece of Happineſs in his earthly Delights, and ſo forget his ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, as he is ready to do, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. yet upon a full and ſerious Survey, of the whole together, ſo far as they may be ſeen, he may be brought to ſee <hi>All Vanity,</hi> and himſelf the greateſt Vanity of all others, in that he miſtakes the right way to his true Happineſs: For when <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſeen all things under the Sun, he concluded, <hi>All is Vanity.</hi> 14. If Men had only diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their hopes to look for, while they neglect the New and Living Way to Felicity, and ſeek their Happineſs in vain and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51442:24"/>
Courſes, their Miſery were the leſs; but beſide this, they ſhall find the Iſſue of their courſe, to be an eating up and gnawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of their Spirit, and that they have been feeding upon the wind, while delighting in Things earthly as their beſt portion. For ſo much is clearly held forth, in the ſignification of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal words, <hi>All is Vanity and Vexation,</hi> or gnawing away of the Spirit, or feeding upon the wind.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words contain the <hi>eighth Argument</hi> to prove that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cannot be had in Things earthly, and particularly that Mens natural Wit ſtretched to the outmoſt in the ſtudy of all things under the Sun for attaining thereto, can bring him nothing but Diſappointment and <hi>Vexation.</hi> The Argument is taken from the impotency and inſufficiency of all the Creatures, and of all humane endeavours about them, to reſtore Man to that primitive Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Nature and Actions, which he enjoyed before his fall, and to reſtore to him theſe Perfections which he loſt by it, (while he ſaith, <hi>That which is crooked cannot be made ſtreight,</hi> &amp;c.) And this the Preacher ſets forth in two expreſſions, the firſt is <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight,</hi> the meaning of which is that that original perverſneſs, and contrariety to the mind and will of God which is in Mans nature, and appeareth in all his Actions, cannot by all the vertue and force that is in the Creatures, or the wit of Man unrenewed, employed about them, be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or ordered, (as the Word <hi>made ſtreight</hi> ſignifies) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the right Rule, the will of the Creator. The ſecond is, <hi>that which is wanting cannot be Numbred,</hi> the meaning of it is, that theſe ſpiritual defects, or privations (as the Word <hi>wanting</hi> ſignifies) which are come upon Man by his fall, cannot be ſo much as known to Man by his natural wit, or <hi>Numbred</hi> out to God who only can ſupply them, much leſs can they be ſupplyed by Man

himſelf, untill he go out of himſelf to God in Chriſt, who makes <hi>crooked things streight Iſa:</hi> 40.4. and ſupplies all that is <hi>wanting</hi> to his People <hi>Phil:</hi> 4.19. And therefore Man cannot expect Happineſs in things Earthly, by all his Endeavours about them. Hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Before Men get grace to choice <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their portion, and ſo be made new Creatures, there is nothing but <hi>Crookedneſs,</hi> and contrariety in their nature and Actions to what is truly good and right in the ſight of God, their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is crooked, ſo as it cannot diſcern things ſpiritual. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.14. And hath upon it ſtrong impreſſions contrary to the truth <hi>Gen:</hi> 6.5. their will is crooked in regard of its averſneſs both from Paſſive and Active Obedience to their maker <hi>Jer:</hi> 31, 18 &amp; 18.11.12. And that the full Benſill of it is toward that which is contrary to God <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8, 11. <hi>Jer:</hi> 17, 9, Their affections are crooked in ſo far as they Loath and weary of what God approves and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Mal:</hi> 1.13. They love and delight in what he abhorrs <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.4. Whence it is that every ſtep of their walk is a turning aſide to their crooked wayes <hi>Pſ:</hi> 125.5. Yea ſo wholly crooked and perverſe is every natural Man, that the more ſtraight he be in regard of External Righteousneſs, the more crooked he is in Gods ſight in regard of his Pride, in not ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. <hi>Rom:</hi> 10.3. for it is mainly of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal perverſeneſs of Mans Nature, which makes all his Actions crooked and contrary to the Rule, wherof the wiſe Man ſpeaks here, ſuppoſing it to be in all Men naturally, while he ſaith, <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtreight.</hi> 2. There are not a few things wanting to fallen Man conſidered in his Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he wants Life. <hi>Eph:</hi> 2, 1. he wants Health <hi>Iſ:</hi> 5.6. he wants Food <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. he wants Rayment <hi>Rev:</hi> 3.17. he wants the Sight and feeling of his wants <hi>Ibid.</hi> he wants deſire to have them ſupplyed <hi>John</hi> 5.40. Yea he wants the Art of numbring out his wants to him that can ſupply them: For, this is the other branch of his woful caſe, <hi>That which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi> 3. The rectifying of this crookedneſs of mans Nature and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51442:25"/>
and the ſupplying of his innumerable ſpiritual wants, is a Work that ſurpaſſeth the Power of all the Creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently requireth a creating, infinit Power for the doing of it <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 10. Only the infinit vertue of Chriſts Death can Crucily the old Man, and make the ſinner a new Creature <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 4. which is to make ſtreight that which is crooked, only he whoſe underſtanding is Infinit, who numbers the Stars <hi>Pſal:</hi> 147.4. and hath in him all fulneſs <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 19. knows the number of our wants, and can ſupply them all, for, it is in reference to the vertue of all the Creatures, improven to the utmoſt by the wit and Power of Man, that <hi>Solomon</hi> thus ſpeaks <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight,</hi> and <hi>that which is wanting cannot be numbred</hi> 4. As Mans Original perverſeneſs, and his innumerable ſpiritual neceſſities, is an ancient Doctrine, which hath been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure manifeſted of old to the Church of the Jews, ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſenſible uptaking of the ſame, is abſolutly neceſſary for fallen Man, in order to his recovering of his loſt Happineſs, as that without which he can never prize nor make uſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of his woful condition, for, <hi>Solomon</hi> here doth clearly Branch out Mans natural ſinfulneſs, while he ſaith <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtreight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</hi> And by his ſo doing ſuppoſeth a neceſſity that every Man muſt know and be ſenſible hereof, before he can take the courſe for remeeding of it, which he points out afterward. 5. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that deſires to be truly Happy, ſhould labour to be ſo ſenſible of the Perverſeneſs and Crookedneſs of his Nature and Actions, of the multitude of his ſpiritual Wants, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of rectifying the one, or ſupplying the other, and ſo deſireous to be ſet upon the way of attaining to the ſame, that every thing which may not be made ſome way ſubſervient to theſe ends, the rectifying of the Crookedneſs of his Nature and Actions and the ſupplying of his ſpiritual Neceſſities, the ſame ſhould be looked upon by him as not only contributing nothing to his true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Contentment, but alſo as full of <hi>Vexation,</hi> and encreaſing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51442:25"/>
his Miſery, ſeeing thereby his greateſt evil is not removed, nor his greateſt defects ſupplyed; and conſequently he ſhould look upon every thing that may ſerve for attaining to theſe ends though his corrupt Nature were never ſo unwilling to endure the ſame, ſuch as the diſcoveries of Sin, and threatnings of Wrath that are in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 20. and 4 15. that new and living Way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 20: to which no Man inclines to ſubmit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. yea Croſſes and Afflictions themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. as ſo many deſirable means of advancing him toward his true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For this Verſe may be ſafely looked on, as a reaſon of that ſentence paſt in the former, upon all earthly Delights and humane Endeavours for contentment in them, to wit, That by them all, <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtreight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered,</hi> the force of which reaſoning is this, That which cannot ſerve for making ſtreight Mans corrupt Nature, nor for numbring out, far leſs ſupplying his ſpiritual Defects, cannot ſerve for making him Happy; but none of theſe things wherein Man naturally places his Happineſs, nor all the eſſayes of his wit and power for attaining it in them, can do any thing in this Work, and therefore they can do nothing toward the making of him tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Happy. 6 However unrenewed Men do ſtrongly imagine, their crooked Nature and Actions to be ſtreight, and conform to the Will of God, that they can love God with all their Heart, and obey him acceptably, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 20 and ſo do perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they have no ſpiritual Wants to mourn for, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. but only matter of Praiſe, becauſe of the multitude of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Recepts <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. Yet the more renewed a Child of God be, and the greater his ſpiritual Gifts are, the more ſenſible he is, of the Crookedneſs of his Nature and Actions <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and of the innumerable multitude of his ſpiritual Wants and defects <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.12. For this verſe may be looked upon as the very ſad Regrate of <hi>Solomon,</hi> a Man very far advanced in Renovation, and endued with many eminent perfections, concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51442:26"/>
of his own, and others Nature and Actions, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his and their ſpiritual Wants, and the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane rPower to rectify the one, and the inability of humane Wit, to reckon out far leſs to ſupply the other, <hi>that which is Crooked cannot be made ſtreight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi>

                  <p>THe preacher giveth here a <hi>ſecond Instance</hi> of the weakneſs and Inſufficiency of Mans Wit, as it is Exerciſed eſpecially about things Morall, or the practical affairs of Men, to direct him how he may recover his loſt happineſs, the ſum whereof is that himſelf after much pains taken to ſee how far a Mans wit, without the ſpecial Illumination, and conduct of the Lords Spirit, can poſſibly lead him right, and how far it ordinarly leads him wrong in reference to the matter of his true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he had found the Iſſue to be nothing elſe but Vexation and ſorrow, inſtead of true contentment. And this may be taken for the <hi>Ninth Argument</hi> to prove his Scope. Now that this Inſtance from his own Experience, may have the more weight, he doth firſt ſhow how he did acquire it, not by a ſlight and careleſs inquiry, but by his moſt Serious <hi>communing</hi> or deliberating with his own Soul. Secondly he ſhowes what Advantages or Furtherances he had, to fit him for profiting in his Study, and did reflect upon, for his encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, to wit. 1. Much Worldly <hi>Greatneſs</hi> ſuch as Riches, Honour and the like, for however moſt abuſe theſe things, yet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51442:26"/>
it appears that he made them his encouragment in his Study. 2. Rare inward qualifications, ſuch as <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> which being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comparativly, made him to excell all that had <hi>been before him;</hi> or (as it is in the Original) <hi>before his Face in</hi> Jeruſalem: And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Wiſdome, and knowledge, which is acquired by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of particulars and bringing of knowledge to practiſe. Thirdly he ſpecifyeth the Object of this Serious Study of his, to which he did apply his heart being incited by theſe Advantages. And that was. 1. To <hi>know Wiſdome,</hi> whereby cannot be meant his Study of ſaving knowledge, as a renewed Man, for that Study could not be cenſured as he doth this in the following words, that it proved <hi>Vexation</hi> and encreaſed his greif; ſeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had declared <hi>Prov.</hi> 2, 10. and 3.17. that that Study brings much <hi>Pleaſure and Peace</hi> to the Soul, but by this Wiſdome which he Studied to know, is meant, the wiſeſt of theſe courſes, that the wit of a Man unrenewed, and deſtitute of the ſpeciall guidance of Gods Spirit, can ſett him upon for attaining Happineſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Exerciſe of his wit in the Study of Morall vertues, ſuch as Equity, Charity, Meekneſs, Temperance and the like, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though even this Wiſdom as he Studied it, was ſubſervient to his progreſs in ſaving knowledge. 2. His Study was to <hi>know Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> whereby he doth not mean that he ſtudied to know the caſe of theſe, who are deprived of the Exerciſe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon, ſeeing ſuch are often very free of <hi>Vexation,</hi> nor doth he ſpeak here of his Sudy, of the Wickedneſs and perverſneſs of his own Heart, in order to the mortifying thereof, becauſe that Study alſo is Bleſt with much Peace, and quietneſs of Spirit: But by this <hi>Madneſs</hi> which he Studied to know, is meant, theſe violent ſinful courſes (ſuch as oppreſſion, unjuſt conqueſt and the like) which Men take for attaining to Worldly Riches, and Honours, and wherein wicked Men uſe to Glory, as if they were renouned by them, as the Word ſignifies, and by <hi>Folly</hi> theſe ſenſual and Beaſtly pleaſures whereunto Carnal Men give up themſelves: He ſtudied the outmoſt in both theſe courſes, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51442:27"/>
might ſeem to promiſe, or bring about any Happineſs to Man, and this he did that he might the more effectually convince all, that true Happineſs was not to be found in theſe wayes. And Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He paſſeth the ſame Sentence and cenſure upon theſe courſes which he did upon the former. <hi>viz.</hi> that the outmoſt that any Man neglecting the Study of Reconciliation with God in Chriſt and of Living in his Fear and Obedience can attain unto, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Exerciſe of Moral vertues, or by giving himſelf up to the ſatisfaction of his Fleſhly Luſts, ſhall be ſo far from bringing him true Happineſs and contentment of Spirit, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it ſhall Eat up his Spirit and (as the original word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) conſume it with <hi>Vexation</hi> at Laſt. From this purpoſe <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. They that would reclaime Sinners from purſuing their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in things Earthly, muſt not think it ſufficient to inlarge themſelves in General Doctrine proving that all Earthly things are Vain, and unable to bring about Mans Happineſs, but muſt give particular inſtances of them, eſpecially of theſe things wherein the greateſt ſhow of Happineſs is, and wherein Men do moſt diligently purſue it, and muſt Labour to convince them of the Madneſs and Folly of their way in purſuing of it in theſe, ſeeing that Doctrine which Men will be pleaſed with in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they will not willingly apply to themſelves in particular 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 12.5. For after that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath by many Arguments in the former words proven in General the <hi>Vanity</hi> and inſufficiency of all the Creatures, and Humane endeavours about them, to lead Man to his true Happineſs, he doth here, and in the three verſes immediatly preceeding, give particular inſtances of theſe courſes which have taken up the beſt of natural Men, wherein they do moſt ſtrongly apprehend their Happineſs to be, and do moſt eagerly purſue it, to wit, the Study of the Workes of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence, of which the former inſtance is given, and of things moral and the practical affairs of Men, whereof this is mainly to be underſtood <hi>I communed with my own heart, ſaying, Lo</hi> &amp;c. 2. They that would make progreſs in the Study of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51442:27"/>
which may be profitable for themſelves and others in order to the attaining of true Bleſſedneſs, as they muſt be much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of the Word <hi>Pſ:</hi> 119.24. And of the Spirit, for light <hi>John.</hi> 16.13. And of others alſo who can give them information in that way <hi>Jer.</hi> 50, 5. So muſt they not neglect to Commune with their own Hearts, by putting them to ponder what the Word holds forth for their direction in that way <hi>Luk.</hi> 2, 19. To bring to remembrance what they have formerly Learned of it <hi>Rev:</hi> 3.3. To conſider the wonted Goodneſs of God to them which may engage them to walk in his way <hi>Pſ:</hi> 77.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To find out Grounds of comfort againſt their diſcouragments. <hi>Pſ:</hi> 4, 4. And frequently to conſider the hazard of miſtaking the way, or ſitting up in it <hi>Heb:</hi> 4, 1 For, <hi>Solomon</hi> while he was upon ſuch a Study, as doubtleſs he made uſe of other Means, ſo he was often <hi>ſpeaking with his Heart,</hi> as the words are in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which are here tranſlated <hi>I Communed with my own Heart,</hi> and the ſubject of his Communing with his Heart, was the ſame with that ſpoken of in the Scriptures cited, as will appear by comparing them with the preſent purpoſe <hi>I Communed with my Heart, ſaying, Lo I am come to great Eſtate.</hi> &amp;c. 3. As there are ſome of the Lords dearly Beloved People, upon whom a very ſmall Portion of the things of this preſent Life is allowed, that they may eſteem the more of better things, and may be taught to truſt God with their daily Proviſion <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.20. So it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to multiply and make exceeding great as the Original Word here ſignifies, the outward Eſtate of others dear to him, that all may know what he can do to his own, and would do to all of them if it were for their true good <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.11. For, here <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> acknowledgeth he was come to <hi>a great Estate,</hi> 4. However Mens proud Reflections upon, and vain Boaſtings of, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and gifts, attributing all to their own Wit, be a deteſtable Sin, and often a Fore-runner of their being deprived in Wrath of theſe things <hi>Dan:</hi> 4.30. Yet it is both Lawful and neceſſary for the Children and Servants of the Lord, to reflect upon and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51442:28"/>
ſometimes to reckon out to others, what His Grace hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, when their ſo doing ſerves to encreaſe an humble and thankful frame of spirit 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7, 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any Meſſage which the Lord hath to deliver by them to others 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 10 For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> reflecting upon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greatneſs, and his inward qualifications, doth it in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, not rekoning out all that he might, he doth it to ſhow what ingadged him to his ſtudy ſpecified in the following verſe, and he doth it to gain the more weight to this uſefull Experience, which here he holds forth to others, <hi>Lo I am come to great Estate and have gotten more Wiſdome</hi> &amp;c. 5 No Worldly Eſtate how great ſoever ſhould ſatisfie the owner, unleſs he have therewith the Addition of Heavenly Wiſdome, which Teaches him how to improve it for his ſpiritual and Eternal Advantage, and without which he cannot but abuſe it and turn it into a ſnare to his Soul. Therefore while <hi>Solomon,</hi> Relates that he was come to a great Eſtate he adds further, and have gotten, or as the Word is in the Hebrew <hi>I have added more Wiſdom</hi> &amp;c. 6. As it is neceſſary for the Children of the Lord to compare themſelves with others in Sin and Wickedneſs, that they may ſee how matchleſs they are for that, and ſo their Hearts may be humbled and free Grace commended 1 <hi>Tim;</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. So it is ſometimes no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to compare themſelves with, and preferr themſelves to others in reſpect of the Gifts and Graces of God beſtowed upon them, eſpecially when they do it not to gain eſteem to themſelves, but acceptance to the truths of God which they are called to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to others, for, for this end mainly doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf with, and preferr himſelf to all that were before him in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and his Modeſty appears in this that the Lord having ſaid to him, that there had been none before him like him for Wiſdome, neither ſhould any after him be like him 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3, 12. He ſaith only <hi>I have gotten more wiſedom than all that have been before me,</hi> and this only to commend the truth of God which he here delivereth to the Church. 7. The Lords People
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51442:28"/>
ſhould not ſatisfy themſelves with the ſimple notional knowledge of the truth, unleſs they have alſo the experimental Knowledge thereof, which conſiſts in our diſcerning evidently the things we know in the cauſes thereof, and by their effects upon our ſelves or others, as alſo when we feel our Hearts ſutably affected, and our practiſe ſuteably ordered to what we know for this riſing of the ſpeach (in the latter part of <hi>verſe</hi> 6.) <hi>Yea my heart had great experience of Wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> imports the experience of Wiſdome a greater Bleſſing than Wiſdom it ſelf, and the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words in the original leads to the deſcription given of experimental knowledge. 8 Theſe to whom the Lord gives this Heavenly and experimental Wiſdome, he ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the great Uſefulneſs thereof to them, <hi>Job</hi> 28.16: That ſo the Heart being applyed to that Study, the whole Man may be ſubſervient to it, and all pains taken in it may be the ſweeter: For, ſo was it with <hi>Solomon, I gave my Heart to know W ſdom.</hi> 9. The moe outward Advantages and Accomodations men have for acquiring Knowledge, and the greater Inward qualifications fitting them for the ſame, the Lord hath beſtowed upon them, the more ſhould their heart be ſet upon Inriching themſelves therewith, otherwiſe the Lord will Challenge them ſadly for abuſing his Gifts contrary to the end for which he gave them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of his giving his Heart to the ſtudy of more Wiſdom, as that whereunto his <hi>great Estate</hi> and former <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Experience did ingage him, while he ſaith, <hi>I communed with my Heart, ſaying, Lo, I am come to great Estate, and have gotten more Wiſdom— And I gave my heart to know Wiſdom.</hi> 10. They that would convince unrenewed Men of the Vanity and Inſufficiency of all the courſes they can take for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to true Contentment and Happineſs, muſt bend their ſtudy much to find out both the utmoſt that natural Wit or Power can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51442:29"/>
reach in things which are of themſelves good, in order to that end, and likewiſe in what vile and abominable Courſes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch Men will readily place their Happineſs, that ſo they may make clear to them how far ſhort both are of giving them the leaſt degree of true Happineſs; for theſe are the ſubject of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Study here mentioned, namely, to know where about the wit of the beſt of unrenewed men is imployed, which he calls <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and to know how baſe and vile courſes (which he calls <hi>Madneſs and Folly</hi>) others of them follow, and ſo to make known that in both Men fall alike ſhort of their fancied Happineſs. <hi>I gave my Heart to know Wiſdom, and to know Madneſs and Folly.</hi> 11. However there be ſeveral ſorts of theſe who purſue their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the Earth, and ſeveral courſes which they take for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the ſame, ſome of them being taken up with the ſtudy of moral Virtues here called Wiſdom; others of them giving themſelves up to their ſenſual Pleaſures, and of theſe ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and boaſting in their Wickedneſs, as if it were their <hi>Renown</hi> (as the word tranſlated <hi>Madneſs</hi> ſignifies) others again Brutiſh and Stupid, having no reſpect at all to their Credit, providing they may ſatisfy their Luſts, as the word <hi>Folly</hi> ſignifies, yet all of them ſhall come alike ſhort of the Happineſs they think to find, and the iſſue and reſult of their Courſes ſhall be the ſame, even Miſery and Vexation, ſeeing the former ſort place their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in their Wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. And the latter, their Heaven in the ſatisfaction of their Luſts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 13. For this which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith he perceived to be <hi>Vexation of Spirit,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of his own Study of theſe preſently mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was at the direction of the Spirit of God, but of the reſult of the ſeveral courſes which unrenewed Men take for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; here ſet forth by the names of <hi>Wiſdom, Madneſs and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I perceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that this alſo is vexation of Spirit.</hi> 12. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord may ſo far favour the ſtudy of natural Wiſdom, and moral Vertues, as to make Men find ſome kind of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Contentment therein, that thereby they may be diverted

from courſes more diſhonourable to him; And may alſo ſuffer men who have given themſelves up to all vileneſs, to be for a time free of vexation, by reaſon of the <hi>ſcaredneſs of their Conſcience,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.3. Yet will he aſſuredly execute the Sentence here paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all who misken or neglect the <hi>new and living way</hi> to Bleſſedneſs through the Blood of Chriſt, ſometimes in this Life, by croſſing the wiſeſt of their Plots, which being effectuate, would have contributed to their earthly Contentment, as he did to <hi>Achitophel,</hi> ſometimes ſtriking them in the midſt of their Pleaſure with his Terror, and other Judgments, as he did to <hi>Belſhazar.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> here gives a Reaſon why the unrenewed Mans Wit can not lead him the right way to his loſt Happineſs, The ſumme of it is, that the more <hi>Wiſdome</hi> any Man who neglects the Study of Reconciliation and fellowſhip with God, can attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he ſhall ſtill have the more grief, or as the Word ſignifies <hi>Irritation of Spirit,</hi> and the more progreſs he maketh in any other Study while this is neglected, he ſhall but heap the more <hi>Sorrow</hi> to himſelf. The truth whereof is evident if it be conſidered, that the more knowledge of that ſort a Man have, he doth but ſee more clearly theſe many inconveniences and Miſeries whereunto he is Subject eſpecially in this Life (which theſe of meaner capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and of leſs proficiency in knowledge do not apprehend, and ſo have leſs <hi>Vexation</hi>) and yet can never ſee the true remedy of theſe, nor any ſutable Conſolation againſt them. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51442:30"/>
till ſaving light come in upon his mind, the more his knowledge of other things grows, he muſt ſtill ſee himſelf the further from true Happineſs. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſpeaking here of ſaving knowledge, conſidering that in other places of his writings he doth attribute contrary effects to that, Namely, that it brings much <hi>Joy and Peace</hi> to the Soul that hath it <hi>Prov.</hi> 2, 10. &amp; 3.17. And yet this is not ſpoken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from, or diſcourage in the Study of things natural, or Civil ſo the right end, not only to convince Man of his folly in apprehending any Happineſs in ſuch Studies while he neglects better, and ſo to ingadge him to the Study of that knowledge which brings much ſweetneſs to the Soul <hi>Pſ:</hi> 104 34. And is able to ſweeten every other lawful Study which is made ſubſervient to it <hi>Pſ:</hi> 111.2. And ſo the words may be looked upon as the <hi>Tenth Argument,</hi> to wean Mens hearts from ſeeking Happineſs in this Earth, ſeeing grief will be the Iſſue of all their endeavours, that way. Hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. While Men are void of the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt, which makes them live in his fear and Obedience, the clearer inſight they have in other things, they draw the more grief and Sorrow upon themſelves The more clear thoughts they have of their duty to God, and of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereof ſomething they may know by natures light <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.19.20. they cannot but have the more horrour of Conſcience <hi>Act:</hi> 24, 25. ſeeing their Conſcience cannot but accuſe them for going againſt their light in many things <hi>Rom:</hi> 2, 15. And they in the mean time being ignorant of, or not heartily cloſing with the way of Reconciliation with God thorow Chriſt 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.8, 9. the more clear their thoughts he anent the immortality of their Souls, they cannot but have the more grief, ſeeing they are uncertain concerning the future State thereof, and can have no well grounded hope that it ſhall be well with them. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.14. And the more progreſs they make in knowledge, they cannot but find themſelves the more Obnoxious to the envy of theſe whom they do excell 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 18, 9. In all which and many other reſpects, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51442:30"/>
truth of this is evident <hi>That in much Wiſdome is much grief, and he that encreaſeth Knowledge encreaſeth Sorrow.</hi> 2. Although theſe that are endued with ſaving Knowledge, and are growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, have ordinarily ſome Grief growing alſo, Namely Godly Sorrow, upon their more clear diſcovery of their own vileneſs <hi>Rom:</hi> 7, 9. their Inability to return ſutable thanks to God for his love 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7.18. And the much diſhonour that God getts by others <hi>Pſ:</hi> 119.158. Yet ſaving Knowledge is of it ſelf apt to bring into the Soul, much joy, Peace, and quietneſs of Spirit, and in the meaſure that Men have it, it doth always bring theſe to them. The great Grief that ſuch have is mainly occaſioned by the defect of that Knowledge <hi>Prov:</hi> 30.2. every encreaſe of their Godly Sorrow, having comfort in the Boſome of it. 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1, 6. and alwayes Joy at the back of it <hi>Pſ:</hi> 30.5. For, what ever is ſaid of this ſort of Knowledge whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks here; the contrary muſt agree to ſaving Knowledge; ſeeing his ſcope is to draw Men from ſeeking Happineſs by the Study of the one, and ingaging them to ſeek it by the Study of the other, therefore as in much of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> here ſpoken of is much <hi>Grief,</hi> ſo in much of ſaving Wiſdom there muſt be much Joy, and as he that <hi>encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſort of Knowledge</hi> which is here meant, <hi>encreaſeth Sorrow,</hi> ſo he that encreaſeth ſaving Knowledge, muſt increaſe his own Peace and Comfort. 3. The more clear diſcerning of other things Men have who are without ſaving Knowledge, and renewing Grace, the more exaſperated, and imbittered do their Spirits grow both at the Lords diſpenſations which croſs their corrupt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.21. And at the ſight of the welfare of others who are better than themſelves <hi>Pſ:</hi> 112.9, 10. And the more do they bend their wit to irritate and provoke the corruptions of others and to grieve their hearts who will not gratify their Luſts 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 1.6. For, this word tranſlated <hi>Grief</hi> doth ſignify and may be tranſlated <hi>Irritation,</hi> which both in the original and in our Language, admitts of an Active and a Paſſive ſignification <hi>for in much Knowledge is much Grief or Irritation:</hi> 4.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> having from his Experience evidenced the Inſufficiency of the higheſt Improvements of the natural Mans Underſtanding in, and Endeavours about Created things, for affording of true and ſolid Happineſs: He doth in this <hi>Chapter</hi> give a further experimental evidence how weak and unable the uſe and injoyment of worldly things is, to produce that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is needful for Man. And in order to this, He <hi>1.</hi> makes a relation with Grief of his deliberate and bent reſolution (while formerly before his Converſion he was a ſtranger to God) to perſue his ſinful pleaſures, as being the riſe of his other groſs miſcarriages: Together with his ſad cenſure thereof (while he was now a <hi>Penitent</hi>) as producing nothing in the iſſue but emptineſs, folly and diſappointment, which he manages by an appeal to theſe Idols themſelves, and the conſciences of Men that follow them, if it be not ſo, <hi>ver. 1, 2. 2.</hi> He gives ſome particular inſtances of the wayes he took for fulfilling his pleaſures, as to the natural appetite and other Delights, ſo far (at leaſt) as to know what ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was in them, which all that time he tempered and mixed with a diligent ſtudy and care to manage his <hi>Royal Affairs</hi> with wiſdom and reputation, <hi>verſ. 3. 3.</hi> He reckoneth up in ſeven branches what fair advantages he had of ſome choice crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, for yeilding him pleaſure and ſatisfaction. As <hi>1:</hi> ſtately Buildings, <hi>verſ. 4. 2.</hi> Plantations of all ſorts for Meat, Drink Medicine and Profitable Fruits, <hi>verſ. 4, 5. 3.</hi> Ponds or Pools of Water, as to contain Fishes for Food and Pleaſure, ſo to ſerve for watering his Incloſures, <hi>verſ. 6. 4.</hi> His numerous train of Servants of both Sexes, partly bought with his Money, taken in War, or hired from abroad, and partly born in his own Houſe, <hi>verſ. 7. 5.</hi> His great ſtore of all ſorts of Cattel beyond any of his Predeceſſors, <hi>verſ. 7. 6,</hi> His great plenty of Money, Jewels, and other precious things obtained partly out of the Treaſures of other Neighouring Princes and Nations; and partly brought to him in Gifts and Preſents by them that either Feared or loved him, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> And <hi>7.</hi> Variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Muſick, both Vocal and Inſtrumental, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> All which might ſeem to make up as perfect a Happineſs as the creature could afford. <hi>4.</hi> As a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he reflects ſeriouſly upon himſelf and his ſinful courſes, and paſſes a ſad cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon them, <hi>ver. 9, 10, 11.</hi> Which reflections of his are <hi>1.</hi> Upon his outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the World, poſitively that he was great both in Dignity and Eſteem, and comparatively even beyond his Predeceſſors. <hi>verſ. 9, 2,</hi> Upon his inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

                     </hi> He declares after ſerious ſearch (wherein perhaps few could out ſtrip him) the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiency of both for bringing about true Happineſs, <hi>ver. 12. (2)</hi> Yet he doth prefer the one (to wit, the ſtudy of natural Wit or Prudence) to the other (to wit, the ſenſual injoyment of creature delights, which he calls folly) as being a good gift of God ſerving as an handmaid to ſaving knowledge, and to diſcover the dangers and profits in a mans ordinary converſe, which the voluptuous man (being in the dark, and not having his eyes in his head) cannot do, <hi>ver. 13, 14. 3.</hi> He ſhews wherein theſe two do agree, that the ſame events for ſubſtance and kind are common to the morally wiſe, and the voluptuous livers <hi>ver. 14.</hi> Inſtanced in his own caſe, which made him ſinfully to condemn that way of wiſdom as altogether uſeleſs, And which miſtaken opinion he preſently cenſures as vanity, <hi>ver. 15. 6.</hi> He gives ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of theſe effects which his ſo much deſired ſatisfaction from natural wiſdom, or creature comforts, and his diſappointments therein did work upon him. As <hi>1.</hi> That the followers of theſe, and their endeavours (as all things elſe) after Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that way, are equally obnoxious to Oblivion and Death, <hi>ver. 16. 2.</hi> That in a fit of impatience of Spirit, through the diſappointments and vanity of theſe courſes, he was ſinfully weary of his life, <hi>ver. 17. 3.</hi> The inordinate hatred and loathing of all his labour in theſe things wherein he ſought his Happineſs, as being things he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to part with to ſome other, and yet knew not what he would prove, or how he would manage or improve, theſe things for which he had taken ſo much pains, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted ſo much Wiſdom and Prudence in acquiring of them, which ſinful deteſtation he cenſures in himſelf as Vanity, and a ſad effect of his purſuing Happineſs that way, while he was eſtranged from God, <hi>ver. 18, 19.</hi> And <hi>4.</hi> That this his ſeeking of Happineſs in theſe things, and being fruſtrated thereof, made him careful to perſwade his own heart to deſpair of ever finding Happineſs in them, <hi>ver. 20.</hi> Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that men of the greateſt parts behoved to leave all their Purchaſe to others that never took pains about it, <hi>ver. 21.</hi> Which courſe he cenſures alſo as Vanity, and as a great evil both of ſin and puniſhment, <hi>ver. 21.</hi> Of which cenſure he gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that man by all his outward pains, and inward vexation about earthly things, is ſo far from any real profit or true comfort, that on the contrary he ſhall have ſorrow and grief, and by his violence in this purſuit bereave himſelf of his nights reſt. <hi>ver.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51442:36"/>
22, 23.</hi> And this alſo he cenſures to be vanity, that a man should thus torment, himſelf in ſo hotly perſuing after that which can hardly be overtaken, and if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken cannot give him comfort, but really grieve him. And <hi>7.</hi> In the laſt <hi>3</hi> verſes of this chapter, to clear that the intent of this Doctrine concerning the vanity of earthly things in order to true Happineſs, was not to deprive men of the lawful uſe and comfort of the creatures, he doth before he proceed further in that ſubject give a short ſum of the true Happineſs which is attainable in this life Where <hi>1.</hi> He diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſomewhat of the nature of that true Happineſs attainable in this life, about which he had <hi>ver. 3.</hi> inquired ſo much (being afterward to give a fuller deſcription of it) to wit, That it conſiſts much in a ſweet conjunction of theſe two: the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51442:37"/>
delights is, to bring him any nearer to that Happineſs which he ſeeks after. And for this end, he doth <hi>First,</hi> relate with how much deliberation, and with what benſill of Spirit he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſenſual delights, and by repeated commands had preſt his own <hi>Heart</hi> (as if it had been too ſlow in the purſuit) to try the outmoſt that creature comforts could do for ſatisfying of him, <hi>Go to now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will prove thee with Mirth, therefore enjoy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> whereby cannot be meant his provocking of his Soul to ſpiritual Mirth and pleaſure in Communion with God, and in his Praiſes; which was the Exerciſe he ſhould have been upon, as his Father had been often before him, for that would have had a ſweeter Iſſue, and more comfortable effects than he found this to have in his own Experience, therefore by this Language of his to his Heart, is ſignified his giving up of himſelf, to the exceſs of Earthly and ſenſual delights which now he is relateing with grief. And this Communing with his Heart ſeems moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be referred to the beginning of his defection from God (as being that frame of Spirit whence his more grievous falls had their riſe) whilſt he was neither enjoying that ſpritual Soul-raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure, and Mirth which ſometimes he had in fellowſhip with God, eſpecially when he Wrote that excellent <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> for then he could not have perſwaded his Heart to ſeek pleaſures of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nature, nor yet was come to that hight of Wickedneſs which he was left unto, before his recovery, as appears by comparing this verſe with the third, where he ſaith that he was <hi>acquainting his heart with Wiſdom,</hi> his Heart was only beginning to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the love of ſenſual delights, and his defection from the Lord faſt growing. <hi>Secondly.</hi> That all who read this, may take it for a penitents relation of his former ſinful frame of Spirit, and ſo may be affraied of falling into the like, before he inlarge it further, he ſubjoyns his Cenſure of it, inviting all to conſider, that the Iſſue of this dangerous reſolution of his, to purſue Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures had proven to him in his ſad Experience, nothing but emptineſs, or diſappointment of any true ſatisfaction. Verſe 1.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51442:37"/>
And <hi>Thirdly.</hi> He inlarges that cenſure which he paſt when he came to himſelf as a true penitent, upon his former ſinful frame, conſidering it both as it did break out viſibly in the expreſſions and geſtures of the outward Man, here called <hi>Laughter,</hi> and as it did affect his heart within, while he delighted himſelf in ſinful ſpeculations, which he calleth <hi>Mirth,</hi> pronouncing the former to be <hi>Madneſs,</hi> (or as the word ſignifies, vain Glorious Boaſting of that which is matter of ſhame to any <hi>endued with the Exerciſe of Holy Reaſon</hi>) and the Latter to be of no worth, or <hi>doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> at all for bringing to Man any true ſatisfaction, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much to the contrary. And that Men tranſported with their pleaſures, may be made apprehenſive that this will be the Iſſue of their courſe, he uſeth a very moving ſtrain of Speach directing the ſame to that Idol Pleaſure, and that by Interrogation, <hi>what doth it,</hi> or <hi>what doeſt thou?</hi> Thereby as it were giving a challenge to the Conſcience of all ſinful Men, to condeſcend if they be able (and the expreſſion imports they are not) upon any true profite they have by their way. Hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. As the Lord hath given this preeminence to Man above all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World, that he can reflect on by his by paſt temper and Actions, and Commune with his own heart for the Future, which he ſhould make uſe of for reſtraining himſelf from ſin <hi>Neh:</hi> 6, 11. For reclaiming himſelf therefrom when he is fallen into it <hi>Jer:</hi> 8, 6. For encourageing his heart in duty <hi>Pſ:</hi> 42, 5. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to truſting in God <hi>Pſ:</hi> 16.2. And to praiſe him <hi>Pſ:</hi> 103.1. In which and the like places there are Holy Soliloquies of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an with himſelf; ſo when the Lord is provocked to withdraw His Gracious preſence, Man can do nothing but abuſe this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to the blowing up of his own corruptions, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging his Heart to Courſes deſtructive to his own Peace and comfort, and which will prove bitterneſs to him in the Latter end, for, thus was it with <hi>Solomon,</hi> at the time to which he here Relates, while the Lords Spirit was withdrawn, and he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon a courſe of defection from the Lord <hi>I ſaid in my heart,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51442:38"/>
go to now!</hi> I <hi>will prove thee with Mirth, therefore enjoy Pleaſure,</hi> 2. Even theſe whoſe Souls have been ſometimes raviſhed with ſpiritual Mirth and delight in God, and have very long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe pleaſures that are Heavenly, even they by their falling lazie and ſecure <hi>Cant:</hi> 5.2. Or waxing proud becauſe of it 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12, 7. May provocke the Lord to withdraw ſo far that they will loſe the impreſſion of that ſweetneſs they have formerly found, and apprehend pleaſure only to be had in Earthly delights, and be ſo eager in the purſuit of theſe, as if there were no better to be had. So that theſe who have gotten much of their Youth, and a great part of their Elder Dayes paſt over in the fear of the Lord and Fellowſhip with Him, have Reaſon even unto gray Hairs and Death to be <hi>working out their Salvation in Fear and Trembling,</hi> leaſt theſe ſparkles of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed Corruptions which have been long keept at under, and are not quite extinct in the beſt, may break out in a flame, even in their old Age; for, this Man of whom we have Ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that much of his Youth, and the great part of his Life, was ſpent in fellowſhip with God, is notwithſtanding at this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the evening of his dayes I <hi>ſaid in my heart go to now,</hi> I <hi>will prove thee with Mirth, therefore injoy pleaſure.</hi> 3. What ever oppoſition there be in the Hearts of Men to ſinful Temptations (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that ſort may be found in the unregenerate, from the clearneſs of their light, apprehending the hazard of their ſinful wayes <hi>Rom:</hi> 2, 15: <hi>Act:</hi> 24.25. And much more muſt be in the regenerate in whom the ſeeds of Grace alwayes remain 1 <hi>John</hi> 3, 9.) Yet while the ſpecial Influences of the Lords Spirit which powerfully divert the heart from ſinful ſpeculations <hi>Pſ:</hi> 119 36.37. and actuate his Grace <hi>Cant:</hi> 4.16. are ſuſpended, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt part will ſo unceſſantly incite, and ſo imperiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole Man, to go over the Belly of that oppoſition, that even a renewed Child of God is in hazard not only to be overtaken by the ſurpriſeall of temptations, and ſuddain motions of his Corruptions, but deliberately to go after theſe, eſpecially
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51442:38"/>
ſuch as promiſe to him much ſenſual pleaſure; How deſperate is the Wickedneſs of the beſt Mans heart? And how great that Mercy and Love of God that follows after him in ſuch Courſes, and powerfully reclaims him? For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> ſetting forth that ſinful frame of Spirit, whence his groſs defection had the riſe, repreſents himſelf ſpeaking to his own Heart as if it had been ſlow in the purſuit of ſinful pleaſures, (and no wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his great Light, and former Experiences of much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religious Exerciſes) and urging it to go over all oppoſition for attaining to theſe I <hi>ſaid in my heart, go to now,</hi> I <hi>will prove thee with Mirth, therefore injoy pleaſure.</hi> 4. A true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will not only with grief call to mind his groſs External Sins, but alſo with what Benſil of Spirit he hath been carried on to them, and will make Language of his ſinful purpoſes, that he may make himſelf more vile in his own Eyes, and will not ſtand to publiſh the ſame, when his ſo doing may reſtrain, or reclame others from the like, or prevent the deſpair of wakned Sinners, affrighted at the ſight of their own vileneſs, and the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ſatisfaction which they expected from their Idols; for, for theſe and the like ends doth this penitent Preacher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his own ſinful temper, and relate the Language of his heart in purſuing his Carnal pleaſures concluding with all, and calling others to conſider, that the Iſſue of ſuch Courſes is nothing but Vanity I <hi>ſaid in my heart; go to now, I will prove thee with Mirth, therefore enjoy pleaſure, and behold this alſo is Vanity.</hi> 5. What ever uſe of corrupt Wit, and Reaſon Men may have for accompliſhing their ſinful pleaſures and increaſing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, the ſame is nothing elſe but <hi>Madneſs</hi> in Gods ſight, ſeeing they are but ſhareing of the beaſts Happineſs, and while they expreſs moſt Joy in the ſatisfaction of their Luſts, they are but <hi>Laughing</hi> at their own Fetters whereby they are held Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Devil; and but like mad Men, gathering fewel to that Fire wherein for their Carnal pleaſures, here called <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> they ſhall for ever weep and gnaſh their Teeth <hi>I ſaid of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51442:39"/>
it is Mad.</hi> 6. As theſe who do moſt madly purſue their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures, cannot poſſibly condeſcend upon any profit they have by their ſo doing, and yet are very hardly brought to conſider that it is ſo; ſo it is a prevailing way for Miniſters to deal with People, and for People to deal with themſelves, to put their Conſcience by queſtions to condeſcend upon the Advantage they have by their way, and ſometimes to direct their ſpeach to theſe Idols they ſerve as their God, and as it were Examine them, as Men do Theeves or Spyes that haunt their houſes, to ſee if they can ſhow men (which is impoſſible for them to do) what profit they bring to them that ſerve them: for as this queſtion may be taken as put to <hi>Mirth</hi> it ſelf, or to the Conſcience of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Man concerning it, <hi>what doth it?</hi> Or as it may be read from the original <hi>what doſt thou?</hi> Imports that Mens ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures contribute nothing to their Happineſs and true ſatisfaction, but much every way to the contrary, expreſt before by <hi>Vexation of Spirit;</hi> So it imports an impoſſibility of getting an anſwer, condeſcending upon any true Advantage Men have by their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures. And this forme of Speach is uſed by <hi>Solomon</hi> to rouſe the Conſciences of Men that ſerve their pleaſures, and to convince them of their Madneſs in ſo doing. I <hi>ſaid of Laughter it is Mad, and of Mirth, what doth it.</hi>

The other is, that he <hi>ſought in his heart to lay hold on Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> (for the firſt words of the verſe are to be conſtructed with theſe which follow after the Parentheſis in the text) by this <hi>Laying hold</hi> he means, his apprehending with all his might, and the outmoſt intention of his ſtrength of minde and Body, and ſo bringing into his poſſeſſion, as the Original Word ſignifies: And by this <hi>Folly</hi> whereof he thus tooke hold is meant thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures, which he now being a penitent judgeth to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>Folly,</hi> though he looked otherwiſe upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Now this his expreſſion of <hi>giving himſelf unto Wine,</hi> it not to be underſtood as if he had given up himſelf to that Exceſſive uſe of the Creatures whereunto Drunkards and Belly-Gods addict themſelves, for though we read of many vile practiſes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his defection, yet we find nothing of that ſort, beſide what is here ſaid, of his <hi>giving himſelf unto Wine;</hi> neither yet can this be underſtood of the moderate and Holy uſe of the Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ordinary with him when he ſpeaks of that (as he doth frequently in this Book) to commend it as Gods gift, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to his own, while as he doth condemn this as <hi>Folly,</hi> and as producing <hi>Vexation of Spirit</hi> Verſe 11. Therefore this ſeems to be underſtood of a middle way betwixt theſe which he ſtudied to wit, that he would ſo far give up himſelf to ſenſible delights that he might know the outmoſt of the ſweetneſs and comfort that was in them, and yet might not turn altogether ſenſual, and Butiſhly exceſſive in the uſe of theſe things. And <hi>next,</hi> to confirme that it was this middle way which he then minded to follow, he doth with the mentioning of it, intermix as it were in a Parentheſis, another Study which he intended to temper with this, namely his <hi>acquainting of his heart with Wiſdom,</hi> whereby
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51442:40"/>
is meant eſpecially his skill of Governing his Royal Affairs, for at his worſt, there is no ground to think that he did groſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry as Drunkards do, and conſequently he hath Studied how to reſtrain himſelf from ſuch exceſſes as might ſtain his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and for that end to carry himſelf at the beginning of his defection, at leaſt in the externals of Religion, as he might hide from the Eyes of his Subjects and others, his begun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Lord. And <hi>Thirdly</hi> he ſhows what was his end in this Study of his (which was indeed a ſingular on, to make a Mixture of theſe two, to give up himſelf to a very full injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſual delights) and to carry on withall the Exerciſe and reputation of his great Wiſdome) and that was that he might <hi>ſee,</hi> or experimentally know as the Word is tranſlated <hi>Eccl:</hi> 1, 16. what was that <hi>chief good</hi> which mortal Men ſhould endeavour to obtain, and may come to the injoyment of, <hi>along their few and numbered dayes</hi> (as the original is) that they have to live in this World, whereby it appears that he doth here relate what frame of Spirit he had under his begun defection, and eſtrangement from the Lord, ſeeing the chief good is now a ſeeking with him, and is ſought after by him in ſuch things as are expreſt in this verſe, <hi>in Wine,</hi> and other things of that nature which he now calls <hi>Folly.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. A true penitent will not ſatisfy himſelf, with general Confeſſions of his former ſinfull courſe, as if he had been but in a common Tranſgreſſion, whereof few are free, and ſo had no other matter of ſhame than other Men, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend upon particulars, both what unworthy idols he hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and how much his wit and ſtrength have been imployed in ſerving of them, that ſo he may be the more vile in his own Eyes, and may make clear to others, the way of the prevailing of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that they may be reſtrained, or reclaimed from giving way to the like; for after a general Confeſſion of his ſinful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to purſue his pleaſures, he doth now inſtance the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that carried his heart away from God, and how much he was taken up with them <hi>I ſought in my heart to give my ſelf unto
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51442:40"/>
Wine.</hi> 2. There are Snares and Temptations wherewith the Godly are readily overtaken, not only in and about things of themſelves ſinful, but likewiſe, and moſt ordinarly, in and about theſe things which are in their uſe lawful and neceſſary, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan knows that we leaſt ſuſpect, and ſo are moſt eaſily inſnared by Temptations in theſe things; for it is imported here that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> found a Snare and Temptation even in theſe things, which ſuch a Man as he, might Lawfully have made uſe of in greater Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and plenty than many other Men <hi>I ſought in my heart to give my ſelf unto Wine.</hi> 3. When the Serious Exerciſe of a Mans Wit is to lay out himſelf, in taking the outmoſt of the comfort which any created thing can yeild unto him; though the ſame were never ſo lawful in the moderate uſe of it, then it becomes his ſin, and his Idol, for, ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcrive the ſin that was in his courſe that he <hi>ſought in his heart,</hi> which ſignifies his moſt Serious Deliberation <hi>to give himſelf,</hi> or as it is in the Original, to draw out his Fleſh; by which is meant his outward Man, and the Actions thereof <hi>unto Wine.</hi> 4. When the Children of the Lord are not ſeeking in their heart to give themſelves away to his Service and Obedience, that ſo they may have more near Communion with himſelf, which ſhould be their moſt ſerious Study <hi>Iſai</hi> 26.9. they will be then ſeeking in their heart how to give themſelves away to theſe baſe and unworthy things, which God hath given to them to ſerve and cheir them in ſerving him; for, here <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> now begun to be eſtranged from the Lord, is giving himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to that which God hath given Man to preſerve his Health. 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5, 23. And to cheir his heart in the Praiſes of his Maker <hi>Pſ:</hi> 104.15. <hi>I ſought in my heart to give my ſelf unto Wine.</hi> 5. How much uſe of Wit and Reaſon ſoever Men may have in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of Earthly delights, yet while they are ſeeking in their hearts, to give themſelves away to theſe things they are but tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of <hi>Folly,</hi> and though the Fooliſh ſinner do not ſo look upon his way while he is purſuing his Idols, yet when God awakes him whether in Wrath or in Mercy, he will ſee and be forced to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51442:41"/>
ſay that he hath been doing nothing but taking hold of Folly, for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, he Exerciſed his Wit how to give himſelf unto Wine, whereby is meant all theſe pleaſures that eſtranged him from God, and now being a penitent he judges his ſo doing to be nothing elſe but a taking hold of Folly I <hi>ſought in my heart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to lay hold on Folly.</hi> 6. As Mens corrupt hearts left deſtitute of the ſpecial preſence of Gods Spirit will incline them in ſome reſpects to the ſtudy of Wiſdom while they are purſuing their Idols, that they may manage their outward Affairs ſo as they may be the fitter to poſſeſs the ſweetneſs they aim at in the injoyment of theſe Idols, that they may be the more able to defend their way with ſhew of Reaſon, to hide from others their defection from God, and to keep their Reputation unſtained: So may the Lord vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chafe upon them even then, the Exerciſe of Wit and Reaſon, that he may make uſe of them to do ſomthing for his publick Honour before the World, while they are doing him much diſhonour privately, and that he may ingage them the more when they come to themſelves to employ their Wit for him; For, <hi>Solomon</hi> now eſtranged from the Lord while he was <hi>giving himſelf unto Wine-</hi> and ſo <hi>laying hold on Folly,</hi> was notwithſtanding <hi>acquainting his heart with wiſdome.</hi> 7. Satan doth not at the firſt tempt Men to that hight of Wickedneſs which he intends to have them at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he will not only permit, but incite them unto ſuch a wiſe ordering of their carriage both in Civil and Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as may hide from others the tendency of their way, and ſilence for a time their own Conſcience <hi>See.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 15.7. <hi>Prov:</hi> 7.14. Counting it ſufficient at firſt to get their Zeal in Religions duties abated, and the delight of the heart drawen toward theſe things which may prove an inlet and occaſion to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temptations; for thus was it with <hi>Solomon</hi> at the beginning of his defection from the Lord, <hi>he ſought in his heart to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto Wine, yet ſo as he acquainted his heart with Wiſdom,</hi> which may be underſtood both of his wiſe Managing the Affairs of his Kingdome, and his viſible reſpect to Religious Ordinances,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51442:41"/>
which afterward he ſhook off when he Eſtabliſhed Idolatry 1 <hi>King</hi> 11.7.8. It is a great guilt in Men to allow themſelves in every way of uſing lawful comforts which doth not deſturb their Reaſon, or make them incapable of manageing their civil Affairs, and of ordering their External Cariage in Religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, while in the mean time the bent of their heart is after their ſenſual ſatisfaction in the uſe of any Earthly delight, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo lawful, for there is no ground to think that <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo give himſelf to Wine that he turned a Drunkard, or indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf for managing his affairs Civil or Eccleſiaſtick in a prudent manner, yea the contrary is intimated here while he ſaith, that when he gave himſelf to Wine He was acquainting his heart with Wiſdom, and yet he ſaith now being a penitent that he was even then <hi>taking hold of Folly.</hi> 9. A true penitent reclaimed from ſin, ſhould impartially reflect upon, and relate as is needful, both how far he hath given up himſelf to purſue his Idols, and what proofs of undeſerved reſpect from the Lord he hath had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with him, and hath abuſed in the time of his defection, that ſo he may be the more vile in his own Eyes, the more thankfull to the Lord, and ingaged now to imploy his wit and parts for him, for, <hi>Solomon</hi> being now a penitent relates both how far he gave up himſelf to his pleaſures, and how far the reſtraining Grace of God was imployed for him at that time, not ſuffering him altogether to loſe the Exerciſe of his Wiſdome, <hi>I gave my heart to Wine, yet acquainting my heart with Wiſdom.</hi> 10. So eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the ſparkles of unmortified Corruption inflamed, even with the very mentioning of ſinful courſes, eſpecially ſuch as have much ſenſual pleaſure in them, that there is need with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them to mention alſo the Folly, Bitterneſs, and hazard of them. Therefore doth <hi>Solomon</hi> in the former words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſubjoyn his Cenſure of his courſe as Madneſs, to his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his purpoſe to purſue his pleaſures, and here while he ſpeaks of his giving himſelf unto Wine, he calls it a <hi>taking hold of Folly.</hi> 11. As there is ſome chief good to be attained in this life,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51442:42"/>
which every Man ſhould ſeek after, and do ſomething every day of his Life for attaining to, ſo, nothing is to be eſteemed that good, but only that which Men may enjoy <hi>all their Days,</hi> and which may be able to yeild them true comfort in all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Conditions they can be in, and this only the favour of God, and fellowſhip with him in Chriſt by the Spirit is able to do, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 34.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuppoſes ſuch a good to be, and to be ſought after while he ſaith <hi>till I might ſee what is that Good for the Sones of Men which they ſhould do under Heaven all the dayes of their Life.</hi> 12. Even theſe who have not only been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and clear concerning that wherein Mans cheif good doth conſiſt, but have been long in poſeſſion and injoyment of it, may be for a time ſo earneſt in the purſuit of their ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ſo forgetful of what they have formerly found in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, that their chief good may be a ſeeking to them, and any apprehenſions they have of it, may be that it is in theſe things that are moſt contrary to it, For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſing the end of his forementioned courſe, ſpeaks as a Man in the miſt concerning that true good, and as apprehending it to be in ſinful delights, ſuch as Wine, to which he ſaith he gave up himſelf, while he ſaith <hi>till I might ſee what was that good for the Sones of Men which they ſhoud do, all the dayes of their Life.</hi>

And. 7. For ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of ſad thoughts which might be intermixed with all theſe injoyments, he had variety of excellent Muſick, both Vocal (and that both of Men and Women) and Inſtrumental called <hi>the delights of the ſons of men,</hi> becauſe therewith Men uſe to be much raviſhed. All which ſeven might ſeem to make up the moſt perfect earthly Happineſs that Man can attain unto, and may be conceived to be here reckoned out ſo particularly for two cauſes mainly; <hi>First,</hi> that his ſad Cenſure which he paſſeth afterward upon all theſe as inſufficient for ſatisfying the Soul, and unworthy to be choſen and delighted in as the Happineſs of a Reaſonable creature, may have the more weight, and be the better believed, ſeeing he doth not under value that whereof he had not Experience himſelf, and ſo might he ſuſpected to envy in others, but what himſelf had long and in a full meaſure enjoyed And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that by reflecting upon the Lords liberality to him in theſe injoyments, he might the more aggravate his own ingratitude, and promove his Repentance, having made ſuch defection from the Lord after all theſe ingagements: and however the uſe of the things themſelves be not ſimply ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor buſineſs about them, be to be abſolutly condemned, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch a man as he, yet conſidering the event, his fearfull falling from God, and what himſelf intimats in the following
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51442:43"/>
words of the exceſs of his delight in theſe things <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And what the Lord ſeems ſharply to inſinuate to him immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the finiſhing of theſe great workes, not only of Hazard, but of an inclination in him, to abuſe all. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9, 6. It is not unſafe to think that his eſtrangement and defection from the Lord, had its riſe from the exceſs of his delight in the things here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that while he was imployed about them, as he here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, his defection hath been already begun upon his Spirit, as was hinted before. Hence <hi>Learn</hi> 1. There is in the beſt ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of love to God, and ſuch ſtrength of love to themſelves, that though they ſtand in need of frequent Exhortations, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragments and threatnings, to put them to that work which concerns Gods Glory and their own ſpiritual good, yet will they freely and of their own accord without theſe, ſett about other works for their own pleaſure and ſatisfaction, which will take them longer time, more pains and Expences; for, even <hi>Solomon</hi> behoved to be preſt by frequent charges and manifold incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the worke of building of the Temple. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22, 6.11.16. For which many materials, and workmen alſo were provided to his hand, and yet without any of theſe he is of his own accord forward enough to make great workes for himſelf, one whereof, to wit, his own houſe did take him much more time, and probably much more expences than the building of the houſe of the Lord, and this his forwardneſs, in theſe works that were for himſelf only, and his eying of himſelf too much in making of them, is inſinuate in this word <hi>to me</hi> ſo oft repeated in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, <hi>I made to me great Works,</hi> and <hi>I built to me houſes</hi> &amp;c. 2. The Lord hath wiſely hedged about earthly pleaſures with much toil and pains, and hath made the attaining of them very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; ſo that a man ſhall ſpend a great part of his time and ſtrength before he come to injoy that meaſure of them wherein with any ſhew of Reaſon he can expect the leaſt ſatisfaction; and this he hath done that man who can promiſe but little time to himſelf, or ſtrength to purſue theſe Earthly delights, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51442:44"/>
of finding ſatisfaction in them, and ſo may be moved to inquire whether there be not a ſhorter cutt to happineſs, and may betake himſelf to the ſtudy of Reconciliation with God in Chriſt and fellowſhip with him, wherein he may be ſure to find true pleaſure, and may come at the ſame ſooner and with leſs pains; for <hi>Solomon</hi> who had as much uſe of his wit, as any that ſhall come after him, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2, 12. having propoſed pleaſure to himſelf, he tells here what he had to do, before he attained to it, how many things were neceſſary for it, and yet that all came ſhort of giving him ſatisfaction. <hi>I made me great works, I builded, I planted &amp;c.</hi> 3. Fallen man may read his Miſery by ſin, upon his outward condition in the World, upon all the Creatures, and his endeavours about them for happineſs: while he builds houſes he may conſider that the open air is hurtfull to him, wherein he could have lived in innocency without cloathing, and that now there is not a Commodious habitation for Man exiled out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, till he be at the pains to make it: while he plants he ſhould remember the Curſe upon the Earth, for his fake, that it will not yeild him what is comfortable and uſefull for him, till he ſweat for it: and while he makes Pools for water, he ſhould remember that the Sea and Clouds are not ſo willing as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they were to ſerve him, who is now become ſo prone to abuſe his fellow Creatures; for upon theſe things and mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours about them, and diſappointment of ſatisfaction in them, <hi>Solomon</hi> reads <hi>Vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> and reckons them out here as things he is to paſs that ſentence upon ver. 11. <hi>I made me great works,</hi> I <hi>built,</hi> I <hi>planted, I made me Pools,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all is Vanity.</hi> 4. The Lord hath not (as in juſtice he might) whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived man of his Dominion over the Creatures, but hath left in them ſome inclination to be ſubject to him, and (upon his pains and labour about them) ſerviceable and comfortable to him; that when the Earth yeilds him fruit, or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſerves him, he may acknowledge the Mercy of his makes who hath not altogether for faulted thoſe to him, and thereby

may be brought to conſider, how ſweet that Eſtate was whence he is fallen, to ſeek Reparation of it in Chriſt, and ſo to be the more ingaged to his Obedience; For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> with Labour and pains, hath the beſt of the Creatures ſerving him, yeilding him matter of Comfort and Praiſe, and ingaging him to his mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Obedience, and all this abundance he reckons out (as for other Reaſons ſo for this) that he may commend Gods Goodneſs in vouchaſing that upon him which he did abuſe, <hi>I made me great works, I planted, I builded, I made me pools, and I got me men Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> &amp;c. 5.

The obſervation of the Lords Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality even in the moſt common and ordinary proofs thereof, were it but in the beſtowing of cattel, the increaſe, and preſervation of them, ſhould not be thought an Exerciſe unſutable for the greateſt Spirits and the moſt eminent Perſons, who ſtand in need of theſe things, for their cloathing, nouriſhment and delight. Men prove themſelves brutiſh in their diſpoſition, who being ſerved by the beaſts, do not take notice of the Lords bounty, and how far he proves his Liberality to them in that and things of that nature, beyond others; for here this penitent man reflects upon this and relates it as a proof of the Lords bounty toward him,

The Lord is abſolute owner and diſpoſer of all the Riches and Treaſures in the World, he can direct men to the Bowels of the Earth, where Riches ly, and can take away the Treaſures of Kings and Provinces from them who have them, and Inrich others with them at his pleaſure, they that want ſuch things ſhould depend upon him for their ſupply, who can if he think it fit, bring them to their hand, and theſe that have them ſhould imploy them for his Glory who can ſtrip them of them when he will for ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> acknowledges <hi>I got me ſilver and gold and the peculiar Treaſure of Kings and Provinces,</hi> 9. The Lord may caſt plenty of outward things to the hands of men who he knows will abuſe them, which diſpenſation of his is Holy, ſeeing he withholds only that influence for the right improving of them, which he is not bound to give, and in the Iſſue proves Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his own, diſcovering their corruption in their abuſe of theſe things for their humbling, and commending his Mercy in pardoning of them, the conſideration whereof ſhould make theſe who want ſuch things, Submiſſive, and conſtruct well of the Lord us intending their good thereby; and theſe who have them in abundance, ſuſpicious of themſelves leaſt they abuſe them, and fearfull of ſnares to their Souls in them, for it is clear that all theſe great houſes, buildings &amp;c. were abuſed by <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>King:</hi> 11: 7.8. And yet after he was corrected and humbled,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51442:45"/>
Mercy was manifeſted to him. 10. So empty are all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and unable to give ſatisfaction, that when man hath his eye fulleſt of the moſt delectable ſights, that they can afford him, his taſte and ſmell refreſhed with the moſt delicious of them, and hath under his hand, abundance of all ſorts of Riches, to provide him with things neceſſary for the time to come, his heart will readily be frequented with ſad thoughts, in the midſt of all, and many cares and fears will readily mix themſelves with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, Therefore after <hi>Solomon</hi> hath all the former, he muſt provide <hi>Singing men, and ſinging women, and muſical Instruments of all ſorts,</hi> to divert his heart from ſad thoughts, incident to him in the midſt of his pleaſures. 11. The Children of men as ſuch, are prone to place their cheif delight, in theſe things that ſatisfy their outward ſenſes: only the Children of the Lord hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſence of his Spirit, can delight themſelves in him, and make his Praiſes, and ſpiritual Exerciſes their Recreation; for, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of this Muſick of the voice and Inſtruments made uſe of to ſweeten the forementioned comforts, he calls it the <hi>The delights of the ſons of men.</hi>

Yet it ſeems moſt agreable to the purpoſe in hand to take this <hi>Wiſdom</hi> for that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gift of knowledge of things natural which <hi>Solomon</hi> had, and for his civill Wiſdom or moral prudence, for managing his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and keeping up his Reputation, conſidering that even that would readily be ſuſpected to be blaſted under ſo great injoyment of ſenſuall pleaſures, and eſpecially that he paſſes cenſure afterward upon all the courſes, which by the conduct of this Wiſdom he followed as <hi>Vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord who ſees it fit to keep ſome of the deareſt of his People very low and deſpiſed for their outward condition <hi>Pſ:</hi> 119.141. deals very liberally with others of them in things of that nature, ſo as to gain them much reverence and reſpect in the mindes of the men of this World, who ordinarily beſtow their eſteem u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the accompt of theſe things, that ſuch of his People may have the fairer opportunity to do good to the Souls of others; for, ſo liberally did he deal with <hi>Solomon</hi> in the particulars fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that this was the reſult thereof mainly in the mindes of others, which he here expreſſes, <hi>ſo I was great,</hi> or as the word ſignifies, Honourably thought of. 2. Whatever outward great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eſteem in the World, the Lord vouchſafe upon any of his Children, they ought carefully to obſerve and acknowledge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51442:46"/>
the ſame, that ſo they may the better ſee, how great their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is to Thankfulneſs to the Lord, and how great their guilt is in not walking anſwerably to it, and ſo be the more humbled; for, ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> (and doubtleſs now being a Penitent for ſuch cauſes) reflect upon and acknowledge that greatneſs, which Gods goodneſs had advanced him to. <hi>So I was great and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is lawful for the Godly to compare themſelves with, and prefer themſelves to others, in reference to the Lords Bounty, and Liberality toward them, when this is not done to highten their own conceit of themſelves, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4 30. when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is attributed to their own worth as the procuring cauſe thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.17. nor That Goodneſs made an occaſion to deſpiſe others who poſſibly have not received ſo much, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.

The Lord may continue with men, the exerciſe of common Wiſdom and Prudence in managing their viſible Converſation before others, even when they being eſtranged from him, have loſt the exerciſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom, and are not following the conduct thereof, and ſo deſerve to be deprived of that other alſo; that he may even in that caſe make uſe of them for doing him ſome Service, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his further Diſhonour by them, and manifeſt his Mercy by covering in part their nakedneſs, which would be ſhamefully ſeen, if he ſhould (when he is provoked) withdraw even the exerciſe of that wit which they abuſe; for this laſt clauſe of the Verſe cannot but be underſtood ſo, as to relate to the time of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Defection, when he wanted at leaſt in a great meaſure, the exerciſe of Spiritual Wiſdom, ſeeing it comprehends the whole time of his proſperous condition which continued even
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51442:47"/>
under his defection, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10, 28. &amp; 11.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even then when <hi>He was great and Increaſed, his Wiſdom remained with him.</hi> 5.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> goes on to deſcribe further the frame of Spirit he had under his Eſtrangement from the Lord, and the Senſe he had thereof, being now a Penitent. And <hi>Firſt</hi> he returns again to ſhow how fully bent he was to purſue his ſenſual Pleaſures, and this he holds forth in two Expreſſions, The one is, <hi>That whatever his Eyes deſired, he did not keep from them,</hi> By his Eyes he means mainly the Affections of his Soul, which are uſually ſo expreſt in Scripture, eſpecially when Luſt or Deſire is attributed to them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. Becauſe theſe take in Objects to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>Job.</hi> 31.1. And do in ſome ſort bewray the tendency of the Affections toward theſe Objects, 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.14. And ſo the Eyes of the Body are here alſo comprehended; Theſe he confeſſes he did not ſeparate, or put far away from (as the Word ſignifies)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51442:47"/>
theſe Objects to which they were of themſelves ſtrongly inclined, as he ſhould have done, <hi>Job.</hi> 31.1, By the exerciſe of holy reaſon, and Grace which he had in the habit. The other expreſſion is <hi>That he with-held not his Heart from any joy,</hi> Which adds to the former, that as he did not ſeparate his Eyes, or Affections from the Objects which proved a ſnare to him, ſo he did not put a Bridle, or Reſtraint (as the Word tranſlated <hi>With-held</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) of the Fear of God and Thoughts of his Love upon his Affections; nor did he prohibite them, which is the chief ſignification of the Word, by his reaſon, to ingage deeply in the Love of theſe Delights, however lawful in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now theſe expreſſions cannot be underſtood as holding forth no more than the uſe of his lawful Liberty in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his allowed Comforts, ſeeing the plain and literal Senſe of them is ſo far from what is commended of that ſort in other Scriptures, ſuch as the <hi>making a Covenant with the Eyes,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did, and praying to turn them away <hi>from beholding Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. And ſo unlike to that command which doubtleſs had been oft preſt upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>rejoyce in trembling:</hi> Beſides, if what he took had been allowed liberty, and joy of the right ſtamp, whereof he here ſpeaks, he could not have paſt ſuch a cenſure, as he doth in the following words, upon his perſuit thereof: And therefore muſt be underſtood of the ſinful exceſs of his Affections pouring themſelves out upon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Comforts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He giveth two reaſons why he took this Liberty to himſelf, which then had been prevalent with him, but now did increaſe his Grief, that they ſhould have been ſo: The 1. is, <hi>That his Heart rejoyced in his Labour,</hi> The meaning whereof is, becauſe he found ſuch ſtrength of Body, and of his natural Spirit, that his very pains and toil (as the word <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> ſignifies) were pleaſant to him, therefore he took this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The 2. is, <hi>That this was his Portion,</hi> which is not to be underſtood, as if God had allowed him to ſatisfy himſelf with theſe earthly injoyments, without Fellowſhip with himſelf, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51442:48"/>
that he did ſatisfy himſelf too much with the ſame, during the time of his diſtance from the Lord, as if they had been his <hi>Portion,</hi> which he might indeed have taken as a <hi>Portion</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to encourage him in ſeeking a better, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He paſſeth Cenſure upon the whole, <hi>to wit,</hi> all his earthly Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Delight in them, as hath been explained, and that his cenſure may have the more weight, he ſhowes it was paſt, after he had turned his Face about, as the Word ſignifies, that is, after ſerious reflection, as a Penitent, both upon all the Works he had done, and upon what he intended to do, but got not accompliſhed: And this he doth in three Branches. 1. That he had met with nothing, but emptineſs, or diſappointment of any true ſatisfaction, which is <hi>Vanity.</hi> 2. That his Spirit was eaten up, or gnawn away with the tormenting challenges of his Conſcience, for pouring out his delight ſo much upon theſe things: This is the <hi>vexation,</hi> he ſpeaks of. And 3. That there was <hi>no profit</hi> in all theſe things, or his Delight in them: the Original bears, he found nothing remaining over and above, that is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides diſappointment and vexation. Hence we may <hi>Learn</hi> 1. When the Lord is not made the Prime Delight of the Souls of men, as he alone deſerves to be <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. there is nothing that can be repreſented to them as deſirable, or pleaſant, but they are ready to give up themſelves to it, ſo that they have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Grace to thank, that they are keept back from the moſt hainous Wickedneſs; for, now while <hi>Solomon</hi> is not delighting in keeping Fellowſhip with God, his affections are let looſe, and not kept back from any thing they incline to, and his Heart is not with-held by him, from any thing he apprehended would make him joyful: And therefore he had not himſelf to thank, that he fell not (though his falls were very hainous) to Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Perſecution, as <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did, ſeeing he ſpeaks this truly of himſelf, <hi>Whatſoever my Eyes deſired, I kept not from them, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held not my heart from any joy.</hi> 2. A true Penitent will not only reflect with grief upon his former practices in themſelves ſinful,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51442:48"/>
but likewiſe and mainly, upon the exceſs and impetuous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his Heart and Affections, going after things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful, not only will he ſo look upon what he hath given his <hi>Heart</hi> to, and fix'd his <hi>Eyes</hi> upon; but alſo upon what he did not keep his <hi>Eyes,</hi> nor with-held his <hi>Heart</hi> from, though otherwayes he hath been hindered, and will mourn for the ſame; for, ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> regrate here, as the ground of the vexation of his heart, that <hi>Whatever his Eyes deſired, he kept not from them, nor with-held his Heart from any joy:</hi> Though it is very probable, that there were ſome things his Eyes deſired, that were kept from them, and ſome Joyes from which his Heart was with-held. 3. So ſtrong is the baiſs of a mans heart eſtranged from God, after ſenſual Delights, and ſo aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and importunate Suiters of them, are his Affections, that except theſe things that are ſinful, or may prove occaſions of ſin to him, be either ſeparate from him, and ſo put without his reach, or the forcible reſtraint of Love to Chriſt vouchſafed in that caſe, come in upon his Heart, and ſweeten it more than it can apprehend any delight beſide could do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Or the powerful apprehenſion of Terror from the Lord, if he ſhould medle with ſinful pleaſures, <hi>Job</hi> 31.23. the Heart and Affections, will run forth exceſſively upon them; ſo that whoever would be kept from ſin, muſt carefully watch againſt all occaſions of ſining: For <hi>Solomon</hi> here regrats that he did not ſeparate theſe Delights from his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and that he did not bridle his <hi>Heart</hi> from them, as the Word ſignifies, importing hereby what he ſhould have done, if ſo be he would have kept himſelf free of theſe things, which afterward proved <hi>vexation of Spirit</hi> to him, and <hi>Whatever mine eyes deſired, I kept not from them, I with-held not my Heart from any joy.</hi> 4. The wiſe Lord, who meaſures out to ſome of his Children that are deareſt to him, ſuch a bitter cup, that they have ſeldom, or never ſenſible Pleaſure in what they do or enjoy in this World, and this even while they are walking with him, and far from delighting in things ſinful,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51442:49"/>
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. ſees it fit to let others of his people, while they are preſuing things ſinful, or things lawful in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, taſte largely of Joy and Contentment, and have their Hearts up in their way, not becauſe he thinks little of their Sins, But that by his Indulgence, he may haſten their Repentance, or (if they do not make this uſe thereof) increaſe the bitterneſs of their exerciſe afterward, for their further Humiliation: for, ſo was it with <hi>Solomon</hi> while he was giving his Heart, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their own ſway, in the purſuance of theſe Delights which afterward proved <hi>vexation</hi> to him; <hi>I with-held not my Heart from any joy, and even then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my Heart rejoyced in all my Labour.</hi> 5. So ſtrong is the deluſion of that Heart, which is left deſtitute, of the gracious and lively Operations of the Spirit of Chriſt, and is purſuing earthly delights, that even theſe exerciſes and courſes for attaining its Idols, which are really painful and ſpending, both of Body and Spirit, will ſeem joyful and pleaſant to it. How may this condemn them who account any pains in Chriſt's Service, which is true Pleaſure <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. a wearineſs <hi>Mal:,</hi> 1.13. for, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſinfully purſuing earthly delights, ſaith, <hi>My Heart rejoyced in all my Labour,</hi> the Word ſignifies <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> even unto wearineſs. 6. Though men oftentimes think it a good enough Warrand to hold on in their ſinful way, that their Heart prompts them ſo to do, and that they can take joy in their way, yet when the Lord awakes the Conſcience, it will appear to be ſo far from a Warrand of their way, that it will increaſe their grief, that they ſhould not only have followed their ſinful wayes, but likewiſe ſhould have had Hearts to rejoyce ſo much in them; for, <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this for a reaſon prevailing with him under his diſtance from the Lord, to give up himſelf to his earthly Pleaſures, but now aggravating his guilt, and his grief, <hi>That his Heart rejoced in all his Labour.</hi> 7, Although there be nothing leſs allowed to Believers for their Portion, than the Lord himſelf, his Favour and Fellowſhip, which alone is able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5, 6. yet when his Spirit is withdrawn from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51442:49"/>
them, they will ſeek after, and ſatisfy themſelves with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing delights of this earth as their portion for the time, which will exceedingly augment their grief, when the Lord reclaims them, for this other reaſon is a part of that which <hi>Solomon</hi> found now to be <hi>vexation of Spirit</hi> to him, that he had looked upon his earthly injoyments, and his joy in them, as his portion; <hi>And this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was my Portion of all my Labour.</hi> 8. As men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of God go on in their own wayes, and never turn their face, ſeriouſly to reflect upon what they have done, ſo, when his Spirit whom they have grieved, is pleaſed to return again, they will make it their exerciſe, to look back upon what they have done, comparing it with the Rule, that they may find matter of Humiliation from it, for, ſo is it here with this peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>then I looked,</hi> or (as the Word is in the Original) <hi>I turned my face,</hi> importing he had before this time, gone on and never looked back) <hi>upon all the Works that my hands had wrought.</hi> 9. When a Prodigal Child of God is come to himſelf, he will ſee and be very deſirous that others ſhould ſee, that every thing he hath ſought after as his <hi>Portion,</hi> hath been empty and void of any true ſatisfaction, that every thing he hath poured out the delight of his Heart upon, beſide the Lord, and Fellowſhip with him, hath but eaten up his Spirit, and left him nothing there but the gnawing worm of an accuſing Conſcience, ſo that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of true profit remaining; nay, nothing at all, beſide that diſappointment and vexation: And if it be thus with men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing exceſſively pleaſures in themſelves lawful, how much more with theſe who purſue things ſinful? For, this is penitent <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's</hi> Cenſure and Judgement paſt upon all his earthly Pleaſures, which he calls all to conſider: <hi>Behold all is vanity and vexation of Spirit, and there is no profit under the Sun.</hi>

                  <p>THis <hi>Penitent Preacher</hi> having with Grief related and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the principal courſes which he followed, during his diſtance from the Lord, for attaining to Happineſs, Namely, the contemplation, and ſtudy of all created things, and the plentiful injoyment of creature Comforts, He doth now compare both together, and ſhows firſt how ſerious he was in ſo doing, he <hi>turned his face</hi> from other things <hi>to contemplate Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> whereby is meant mainly the knowledge of things Natural and Moral, or whatever mans wit, without the ſpecial conduct of the Lords Spirit, can find out for attaining to Happineſs, And <hi>Madneſs and Folly,</hi> by which he means all theſe ſenſual Delights formerly mentioned, wherein men place their Happineſs, As he had looked upon both apart, ſo now he conſiders both joyntly, and cannot paſs from his former Sentence of both. And next, becauſe he did foreſee that many Inferior to him, would preſume to find Happineſs where he had been diſappointed, therefore he put this queſtion to them, <hi>What can the Man do that cometh after the King?</hi> Which hath the force of a denyal (as appears by the anſwer here ſubjoyned) <hi>viz.</hi> That no man after <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf ſhould ever be able to do any thing to lead him nearer an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Felicity, by trying the like courſes, than he had done: And the ground of this is ſuppoſed, that none can expect to have more advantages, and helps to make them profit in ſuch a ſtudy, and ſucceſsful in ſuch an attempt; And this is both a Reaſon of his painful ſtudy, taken from his fitneſs, and many advantages for it, and likwiſe an Argument to make his Judgment and Cenſure paſt upon ſuch courſes, have the more weight: And ſo to draw others from eſſaying to ſeek Happineſs in the like way.</p>
                  <p>Beſides what was obſerved from ſome expreſſions. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 17.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51442:50"/>
We may learn 1. While the Heart of man is not fixed upon the Lord, and taken up with that ſweetneſs which is to be had in his Fellowſhip and Service, it will be ſtill wandring from moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to hill, forgetting its reſting place, which proves to ſome a juſt correction in diſpleaſure for their folly, and to others a merciful exerciſe to make them return to their firſt Husband: For, Thus doth <hi>Solomon,</hi> beginning to be reclaimed from his defection, repreſent himſelf as one frequently turning himſelf about, Having ſaid in the former <hi>verſe, He turned his face,</hi> he ſaith here again, <hi>and I turned my ſelf to behold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that would attain to any degree of ſound knowledge, and right apprehenſion of things, which may be profitable for themſelves and others, they muſt not only have their Hearts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from other unprofitable things, and be frequent and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their thoughts of theſe that may profit, but after they have looked upon every one of them apart, they muſt conſider them joyntly, and compare one of them with another: For, here <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he might root this experimental knowledge in his own Heart, concerning the inſufficiency of all the Creatures, humane endeavours about them, and the fulleſt injoyment of them, for bringing about mans true Happineſs, after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all his Courſes for that end apart, he turns his face again, importing his ſeriouſneſs to conſider them jointly, <hi>I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to behold Wiſdom, and Madneſs and Folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The utmoſt of Comfort that Creatures can yeild, when Happineſs and Contentment is ſought in them, may ſoon be attained: It is no ſuch depth, but that it may be ſounded by theſe who will put it to the tryal, which yet they ſhall do to their great grief and vexation: One man may in a ſhort time find out ſo much thereof, as that he may defy others after him to find more: Whence appears a manifeſt difference between Heavenly and Earthly Conſolations, the Heavenly being ſtill upon the growing hand, and incomprehenſible by any of the Saints till in Heaven they be filled with all the fulneſs of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51442:51"/>
19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> at the direction of the Spirit of God profeſſeth himſelf to have been at the bottom of earthly delights, ſo as none after him could go deeper. <hi>What can the man do that cometh after the King?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord hath not only aſſured us by his Word, that if we ſeek Happineſs in any thing beſide himſelf, we ſhall meet with diſappointment and vexation, but alſo hath given us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Teſtimonies thereof, under the hand of theſe, who to their grief have eſſayed it, whoſe Teſtimony we cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon queſtion, ſeeing we cannot rationally imagine to equal, much leſs to excel them in advantages for attaining to that Happineſs; For here is the Teſtimony of one who excelled all meer men in Wiſdom and many other things alſo, giving us, in the Lords Name, warning, that it ſhall be folly for us to make a new eſſay of finding Happineſs where he was diſappointed. <hi>What can the man do that cometh after the King? even that which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. So bent are the Hearts of men naturally upon an Earthly Happineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. and ſo ſtrongly conceited of their own ability to attain it. <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. that though they hear the perſuit of it condemned as vain and vexatious, by theſe who wanted nothing to gain credit to their Teſtimony, yet will they ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord change their Heart) intertain hopes of attaining it, and preſume to do ſomething more for that end than any others have done before them: For this Queſtion is to check mens vain hopes, and preſumption of doing ſome new thing, and more effectual than what hath been done before, for attaining to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in things Earthly; <hi>What can the man do that cometh after the King? even that which hath been already done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As it is no ſinful arrogancy nor violation of Chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, to commend our ſelves, when the ſame may commend the Truth, and is done for that end; ſo when it is neceſſary for men to ſpeak any thing may ſavour of their own praiſe, or preference to others, they ſhould not only be ſure, that they

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The more fit qualifications, and advantages the Lord hath given men, for attaining to the knowledge of the Truth, as they ſhould be the more diligent in improving them, and that they may provoke themſelves thereto, ſhould be the more frequent in humble reflecting upon any thing, wherein the Lord hath made them to excel others, ſo ſhould the ſame gain the more weight in the minds of People to the meſſage they carry, for, this queſtion may ſafely be taken both for a reaſon, why <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſo ſerious in the ſtudy of the way to Happineſs, and likewiſe why his Doctrine ſhould have weight with all that hear it; <hi>I turned my ſelf to behold—, and what can the man do that cometh after the King? even that which hath been already done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is the Lords way, who ſearches and knows the Hearts of men, to meet with the moſt ſecret motions and inclinations thereof, by his Word: and therefore it ſhould be the ſtudy of all his Miniſters ſo to apply his Truth, as the ſame may diſcover the hidden wickedneſs of Peoples Heart, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58.1. And ſo ſhould it be the great deſire of people to have the ſecrets of their Heart diſcovered to them by the Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having compared together theſe two principal wayes, wherein the moſt part of men ſeek to attain Happineſs, and whereof Himſelf had tryed the outmoſt, and having declared them equally inſufficient for that end; leaſt he might be thought to undervalue the one (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſtudy of Natural <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or Moral Prudence) in all other reſpects, as he had done in order to its leading the Students of it to true Happineſs; He doth here commend it as a good Gift of God, fit to be a handmaid to ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge, and mainly as it ſerves for the advantage of humane Society and prefers the ſtudy of it to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The voluptuous, or ſenſual Life, which is ſpent in Carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which he calls <hi>Folly,</hi> becauſe it doth much darken mens reaſon, and turn them Sottiſh, who give up themſelves to it: And this preference of the one to the other, He illuſtrats by the ſimilitude of <hi>Light,</hi> which far <hi>excels Darkneſs, verſ.</hi> 13. And proves the ſame by Reaſon, taken from the effects of both, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the man indued even with this common ſort of <hi>Wiſdom hath his Eyes in his Head:</hi> The meaning whereof is, that he is by it much enabled to foreſee the hazards and advantages of his Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to guard himſelf againſt the one, and provide for the other, and ſo in ſome meaſure to walk equitably, and ſoberly, for the good of humane Society; while as on the contrary, the Senſual man, who hath drowned his wit in his Pleaſures, is as if his Eyes were in the ſoles of his feet, and ſo he walks inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and is ready to run into many hazards unawares, as one that is walking in the dark. Now though all that is here ſaid to the commendation of this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> doth truly, and far more ominently agree to ſaving knowledge; yet by what he ſpoke
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51442:52"/>
of this <hi>Wiſdom, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. and by what he ſpeaks afterward of the woful effects of it in this Chapter, it doth clearly appear that he intends not a commendation of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> And having ſhown wherein the one of theſe courſes doth excel the other, he comes to ſhow in the next place, wherein they both agree; whereby he proves the vanity and weakneſs of that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (for leading man to Happineſs) which he had commended before in other reſpects. The firſt thing wherein they agree, is, That the ſame events are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to theſe that are <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and to theſe that are <hi>Fooliſh,</hi> in the ſenſe formerly mentioned. By events is meant (as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) the Occurrences of Providence, which fall out beyond mans foreſight or expectation. And though the Word tranſlated (<hi>event</hi>) be uſed in Scripture for Proſperous and Comfortable Occurrences, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.12. yet the following inſtance makes it clear, That it is to be underſtood here of ſad and diſmal events, and ſuch as are contrary or do <hi>come against</hi> (as the Word alſo ſignifies) Mens natural Inclination. And yet the meaning is not as if every one of both ſorts of men here ſpoken of, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meet with the ſame kind of ſad events, ſeeing experience teacheth, that ſome ſenſual voluptuous Men will be keept free of ſuch, and ſuffered to enjoy their Pleaſures, while the morally wiſe and ſober Man will meet with them ſadly; But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that neither the foreſight or prudence, wherein the one ſort pleaſe themſelves, as the beſt way to their Happineſs; nor the abundance of earthly Delights, whereof the other hath no leſs eſteem, can either hold off or ſweeten any ſad event that may befall either of them. And though it be true that the ſame ſad events for the ſubſtance or kind of them, may in time befall theſe that are endued with ſaving knowledge, which do befall either of theſe two ſorts formerly mentioned; yet to the godly the natures of theſe are changed, to work for their good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. But to others ſad events are incident, which are not only the ſame for kind, but alike comfortleſs.</p>

Even of theſe Courſes which natural men take for Happineſs, and which are equally inſufficient for bringing it about, there are ſome of them to be preferred to others, as having leſs open diſhonour to God in them, ſerving more for the good of humane Society, and the temporary comfort or the men them ſelves, and keeping them in fitter Capacity for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, if ſo be he ſhall viſit them with his ſaving Grace; as the ſtudy of Moral Vertue and Wiſdom, whereof the Lord hath ſome ſort of liking <hi>Mark</hi> 10; 21. And others again to be more detaſted, as tending more to the publick diſhonour of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. quenching the remainders of natural light in men <hi>Hoſe</hi> 4.11. and rendring them incapable of Inſtruction <hi>Prov.</hi> 5, 12. as the exceſs of Carnal Pleaſures doth, which is here call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Folly;</hi> For, <hi>Solomon</hi> comparing theſe two together, the ſtudy of Moral Wiſdom, and Senſuality, both which he had before pronounced vain, empty of ſatisfaction, and inſufficient for making them Happy who ſeek no better, he doth here prefer the one to the other. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Wiſdom excelleth Folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The comparing together of what is good and evil, better and worſe, ſerves much for the producing of clear thoughts of both in mens minds: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> having ſhown in the former Verſe that he did joyntly conſider, or compare together, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> gives account here what ſucceſs he found in ſo doing; Namely, that he is now able to ſhew wherein the one excels the other, and wherein they both agree, <hi>Then I ſaw that Wiſdom excelleth Folly.</hi>

And this inſtance as it is verified in time, He proves by the univerſal forgetfulneſs, wherein both the Perſons and Actions of the preſent Generation, will be buried in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Seeing that which now is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the days to come ſhall all be forgotten,</hi> Which likewiſe is to be applyed only to the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, and in the ſenſe preſently mentioned, ſeeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God and his Works will be kept up in his Church while time endures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.17. The next inſtance is, that this <hi>wiſe man</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>ſhall die like the fool,</hi> Which is held forth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51442:57"/>
in a Queſtion, importing his admiration and indignation, (<hi>viz.</hi> while his Heart was eſtranged from the Lord) that it ſhould be ſo: Now this equality of theſe two ſorts of men, the Morally wiſe or ſober, and the Senſual fool, in reference to their Death, is not to be underſtood of the particular kinds of their Death, or the circumſtances thereof, which uſe to be various in differing perſons, but that all the Wiſdom of the former ſort, ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be able to prolong their Life, nor give them any more true Comfort in Death (ſeeing they have lived without the ſtudy of ſaving knowledge) than they have who never cared for ſuch Studies, as theſe have been raviſhed with. And though this Queſtion may be concerning the certainty and kind of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death incident to the Godly Man as well as others, yet as to the quality of his Death, he doth not die as they do, for his Death is the beginning of his eternally bleſſed Life, and he ſhall live after his Death with God <hi>in everlaſting remembrance.</hi> But for theſe wiſe Men, and Fools here ſpoken of, every one dies as another, they are at Death equally ſeparated from their fancied Happineſs, and Death is to all of them the Port and Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Eternal Torment.</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Though the deſire of eſteem among men, eſpecially the continuance of it after death, be of it ſelf vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. yet the Wiſeſt and Beſt of men deſtitute of ſaving Light and Grace, do ſtrongly incline to purſue it even as their Chief Happineſs, and can with more difficulty than any others be convinced of their Vanity in ſo doing; For it is this ſort of wiſe Men, that the Spirit of God here equals with the <hi>fool,</hi> and labours ſo much to convince of Vanity in counting themſelves more truly Happy than others, becauſe of their Wiſdom, while he ſaith, <hi>There is no remembrance of the Wiſe more then of the Fool for ever.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The more wit men employ in purſuing any thing as their Happineſs beſide Gods Favour, and the more earneſtly they purſue the ſame, the more will the Lord walk contrary to them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51442:57"/>
and ſet himſelf to blaſt their courſes for attaining to it, For the Spirit of God directs his Speech here mainly againſt theſe Wiſe men, who had much more to perpetuate their Memories by, and did more for that end, than theſe with whom he doth equal them: They are ſuch whom he here certifies of that which is very vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to them to conſider (as will appear by what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in the following <hi>verſe</hi> of himſelf, while he had ſomewhat of their temper) <hi>There is no remembrance of the wiſe more then of the fool for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The preſent Generation, and all that live in it, ſhould look upon themſelves, and all their outward Enjoyments, as not only fading, and of ſhort continuance, but as ſhortly to be quite forgotten, and ſhould apply the ſame conſideration to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their particular Idols, in the enjoyment whereof they place their Happineſs, the more to wean their hearts from them, and not pleaſe themſelves with general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Vanity, and fading nature of all things: For the Wiſe man makes this general conſideration a proof of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that both the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and the <hi>Fool</hi> ſhall be forgoteen, <hi>Seeing that which now is, in the dayes to come ſhall all be forgotten.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Though temporal Death abides the Godly as well as the Wicked, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. yet there is a great difference, between the manner or qualities of the Death of the One, and the Other.

The Word tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Life,</hi> is Plural in the Original; Importing, that he hated all ſorts or ways of living imaginable in this World: Which is not to be underſtood of his hating his natural Life, ſo far as to be willing to lay it down for God, when he ſhould call for it, nor of his undervaluing of it comparatively, in reſpect of that better Life, which made <hi>Paul</hi> long to be diſſolved, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.21. both which are commendable.

humble his Spirit. And that this hatred of his Life is thus to be taken, will appear by conſidering the reaſons which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with him for producing of it. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That all the Works under the Sun, were grievous to him, ſo did the Lord imbitter theſe things reckoned out toward the beginning of the Chapter (wherein he too much delighted) that he might bring him to Repentance; If he had not taken too much pleaſure in theſe Works, they had not now been ſo grievous to him, nor would he have hated his Life: Becauſe they were ſo. The <hi>Second</hi> which is alſo the cauſe of the former, is, That he found emptineſs of ſatisfaction, and nothing but a gnawing of Spirit to be the reſult of all theſe courſes in order to Happineſs, which he had taken during his eſtrangement from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>From this we may learn 1. How ſoon and eaſily the Lord who only hath dominion over the Spirits of men, can make a change upon them; and make him who lately had a pleaſant Life, and rejoyced in all his Works, hate his Life, and find all his Works grievous to him: For, <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in the 10 <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter ſaith, <hi>He rejoyced in all his labour,</hi> Is now brought to ſay, <hi>I hated life, becauſe the work that is wrought under the Sun is grievous to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. So hardly are the deareſt of Gods Saints reclaimed from perſuing Earthly Delights, when once they have given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto, that neither the voice of the Word, which <hi>Solomon</hi> wanted not all his time, nor the voice of Conſcience, together with the ſweet motions and ſuggeſtions of the Spirit of God, which is vouchſafed ſometimes upon the Saints under their deep Security, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. are ſufficient to awake them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, until the Lord ſend bitterneſs upon their Spirits, and upon all their Idols wherein they delight, with which alſo the work of His Spirit muſt concur, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14.

He conſidered that he behoved to part with all theſe things. 2. That he behoved to leave them to ſome other, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 3. That it was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to know whether his Heir ſhould prove <hi>Wiſe</hi> or

                     <hi>Fooliſh.</hi> 4. That whatever he were, he ſhould be abſolute Maſter of all that he had. 5. He conſidered that he had taken exceeding much pains. And 6. That he had manifeſted much Prudence and Skill in conquiſhing and managing thoſe great things: all which conſiderations did highten this ſinful Diſtemper, the hatred of his Labour. Whereupon <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he ſets down his Cenſure, That all this is <hi>Vanity,</hi> which is not to be applyed to the neceſſity of mens leaving their Subſtance behind them at death to an Heir, unknown for his future Diſpoſition and Carriage, ſeeing that is an ordinary event of Providence, but it is to be applyed to the whole caſe here mentioned, <hi>to wit, His hatred of his Labour</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch grounds as are here expreſt, and to mens placing Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch things, as they muſt leave behind them.

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. When men exceſſively love and delight in any Created thing, The Lord is thereby juſtly provoked to turn that Love into hatred, and indignation: and in much Wiſdom and Mercy doth he ſo, ſeeing they will not take off their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from theſe things, till they be made odious to them; nor will they till then place them where they ſhould be: For <hi>Solomon</hi> who doubtleſs was ſinfully taken up with delight in his Labours during his diſtance from the Lord, ſaith now, <hi>Yea I hated all my labour.</hi>

There is ſo much ſelf-love in all men naturally, and ſo little love to the Glory of God, and the good of others, that if the Heart be left to its own perverſeneſs, it would rather choice that any gift it hath formerly received from God, and found ſweetneſs and comfort in, and now miſſes it, ſhould periſh and go to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than that others ſhould enjoy it, or themſelves have no Comfort of it: For, this even <hi>Solomon</hi> declares to have been a part of the ground of this ſinful diſtemper of his ſpirit, <hi>That he hated all his Labour, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhould leave it to the man that ſhall be after me.</hi>

                  <p>LEaſt the Preachers former Doctrine concerning the Vanity of things Earthly in order to the ſatisfying of a mans Soul, might be miſtaken, as if the intent thereof were to deprive men of the comfortable uſe of Gods good Creatures, before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it further he doth here open up a little, the nature of that wherein true Happineſs doth conſiſt, which he doth more fully clear afterward: And ſo in few words clearly determines what is that good for the Sons of Men in this Life, which he ſaid he was ſo inquiſitive about, in the <hi>third verſe</hi> of this <hi>chapter.</hi> And this he doth in ſuch a way, as may be moſt prevalent with men raviſhed with earthly delights: And for this end he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhow, that that Happineſs which is attainable in this World, conſiſts in the conjunction of theſe two. The 1. relating to the outward man, is the Holy, Sober, and Cheerful uſe of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature Comforts, which the Scripture comprehends under the Name of <hi>our daily Bread,</hi> and he calls <hi>Eating and Drinking;</hi> for, thus muſt the Eating and Drinking here commended be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and not of a mans giving up himſelf to the exceſſive uſe of ſenſual Delights, conſidering that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſo much condemned this before, as unworthy to be choſen for a mans portion, and that the ſame is altogether inconſiſtent with the good of the Soul. The 2. relating to the Inner-Man, to which the former muſt be ſubſervient is, that he <hi>make his Soul enjoy good,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of ſome good ſuteable, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the Soul, as no ſenſual Delight can be: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be that ſweet Fellowſhip which reconciled Souls have with the Lord, while they walk in his Fear and Obedience,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51442:67"/>
which he preſſes in the cloſe of this <hi>Book;</hi> and this is to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by man as the good of all his Labour, or pains he takes in this World, the end of his Eating, Drinking, and uſing all the lawful comforts of this life. <hi>Next,</hi> He doth confim that this Good conſiſts in the conjunction of theſe two, from his own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge and experience, <hi>he ſaw,</hi> viz. by the light of the Word, and the Spirit of God now preſent with him, and by his own obſervation, that <hi>all this,</hi> to wit, all lawful creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the power to make uſe of them, and find ſweetneſs in them, and eſpecially the Grace to uſe them ſo as the Souls good may be thereby promoved, <hi>All this was from the hand of God:</hi> whereby is meant his liberality inlarged toward man, in allowing theſe Comforts upon him, and his powerful Bleſſing cauſing him ſo to uſe them; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.28. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to gain weight to his teſtimony concerning this matter, he ſhows he was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none for plenty of creature Comforts, and opportunity to make uſe of them ſpeedily, without much labour to him; and therefore was to be believed in this, That Happineſs was not in the injoyment of outward Comforts alone, but only in ſuch a Holy and Chearful uſe of them, as might be ſubſervient to the Souls good, which conſiſts in Fellowſhip with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. Though the publick Miniſters of Chriſt ought to deliver the whole Counſel of God to the People, as they have ability and opportunity, <hi>Act</hi> 20.20, 27. Yet is it Wiſdom in them while they have to do with theſe that are ſtrangers to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord, eſpecially ſuch of theſe as are raviſhed with Earthly Delights, to bring forth in the firſt place ſuch Truths as may probably be moſt taking, prevalent, and have beſt acceptance with them, ſuch as theſe are that do concern the Lords large allowance of as much comfort, even in outward things, as men can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reaſon deſire: That Soul-raviſhing ſweetneſs is only to be found in Spiritual Exerciſes, which will make all ſinful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights loathſome, and refine the lawful Sweetneſs that is in the Creatures; And ſo, that Religion is a friend both to the Bodies
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51442:68"/>
and Spirits of men: For, this is <hi>Solomon's</hi> method here, who without doubt, is directed to frame this Book mainly, for the convincing and gaining of Men, who are in the way that he himſelf was in, before his recovery from his defection. He doth not at the firſt deliver the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> having ſpoken ſomewhat concerning the Inſufficiency of the moſt plauſible and promiſing courſes, which men deſtitute of the Lords Spirit can take for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, before he proceed further he inſerts here ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of true Happineſs, that men may have the clearer thoughts of it, while he ſaith, <hi>There is nothing better for a man then that he ſhould Eat and Drink, and make his Soul injoy good of his Labour.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The conſideration of the Lords large and comfortable allowance to His Own; ſhould move All to take them to His Way of ſeeking after Happineſs, and therefore this allowance ſhould be much inſiſted on by his ſervants, and often viewed by People, that their hearts may be ingaged to that way: For this deſcription of the Lords liberality, and ſweet allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his own, is here brought in as a motive to make men fall in love with that Way to Happineſs formerly hinted at. <hi>For God gives to a man that is good in his ſight, Wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and joy.</hi>

                  <p>THis verſe contains the firſt conſideration, ſerving to quiet the Hearts of the Godly, eſpecially againſt the many ſad changes that are in this World, to wean their hearts from ſeeking Happineſs in things Earthly: As alſo to move all to obſerve the fitteſt opportunity of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and purpoſes, and to depend upon Him who hath the times in his power: The ſum whereof is, That every event (whether it fall out in humane and voluntary Actions, which ſeem to be moſt in mans own power, or in the daily working of Gods Providence, both which are here to be underſtood, not only becauſe of the largeneſs of the expreſſion <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon,</hi> But mainly becauſe the following inſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both) hath a ſeaſon, the Word ſignifies, <hi>A fixed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or foredetermined Time;</hi> and is ſo tranſlated <hi>Eſth.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10.14. And this fixing of the ſeaſon of every thing, is to be underſtood in reference to Gods eternal decree foreor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51442:73"/>
all Events, as is clear by comparing this with <hi>ver.</hi> 11. where he ſaith God hath made every thing beautiful in his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: This ſame conſideration he doth in another expreſſion apply to mens purpoſes, or reſolutions, eſpecially ſuch as men have complacency and delight in, as the Word tranſlated <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> ſignifies. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.19. Even for theſe there is a Time, the Word alſo ſignifies <hi>a ſet time Neh.</hi> 2.6. out of which men cannot ſo much as conceive or reſolve the doing of any thing, much leſs act it: The Words alſo may be looked upon as pointing at mans Duty to obſerve a fit time and ſeaſon in all his Actings.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Though future Events, the time whereof cannot be known in their natural cauſes, he wholly uncertain to us <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. Yet are they all clearly foreſeen, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly foreappointed, and that from Eternity <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 18. by the infinitly wiſe Lord, ſo that they cannot fall out ſooner or later, than in the time that he hath appointed for them; for in reference to his Eternal Counſel mainly is this to be underſtood <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mans will is not an Independant thing: man is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of his purpoſes, nor doth the Lord look through the proſpect of mans Free Will to ſee that will fall out according as it ſhall of it ſelf encline; But he in his Eternal Council hath wiſely ordered all the motions thereof, for, <hi>There is a time for every purpoſe.</hi> The Word ſignifies (Volition) or the very act of the Will, and may be underſtood of humane purpoſes, as ſeveral of the following inſtances muſt alſo be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though there be no ſeaſon or time allowed for ſinful Actions or purpoſes, ſince negative precepts oblige in every article of time; yet wicked men can neither act wickedneſs, nor purpoſe it, but in the time wherein God hath reſolved to permit the ſame, withdrawing his Grace, which he is not bound to give, for even of wicked mens Actings, ſuch as their perſecution of the Godly, and their wicked Plots and purpoſes,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51442:74"/>
may this be underſtood, <hi>There is a ſeaſon for every thing, and a time for every purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Every Duty is not to be gone about at every Seaſon, but the due opportunity thereof to be carefully ſearched for, by conſidering the general Rules of the Word, eſpecially what Duties ſuch Diſpenſations call for. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. by praying for the Lords teaching to know the Times 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.32. and laying to heart the ſad challenge given to thoſe that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. For, in reference to the Duty of man that would enjoy that True Happineſs which he pointed out before, as ſome of the following inſtances make clear, this conſideration may be taken, as a direction to them to obſerve the Seaſon. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It ſerveth much for quieting the hearts of the Godly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the ſad changes of Diſpenſation that are in the World, to conſider that all theſe fall out in the Times and Seaſons ſet and fixed for them in Gods Eternal Counſel, who minded the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of His Own from all Eternity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. And is ingaged to bring their good out of the worſt that can fall out in time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And particularly to believe that enemies cannot ſo much as Plot, much leſs raiſe up Trouble or Perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but at the time wherein he hath foreſeen it fit to Exerciſe them therewith 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. Nor can their Tryals continue longer than His ſet time for expreſſing His favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in their delivery is come <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13. For, this according to the ſcope of the Book cannot but be taken for a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerving to hold off vexation from the hearts of the Godly, and keep them in the chearful poſſeſſion of their ſpiritual Happineſs, that, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe under Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. This ſame conſideration, that God hath fixed a time for all things and purpoſes, may ſerve to wean mens hearts from ſeeking Happineſs in any thing beſide himſelf, ſeeing he hath
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51442:74"/>
in his hand the Time of their coming to enjoy theſe things, the continuance and the removal of them, beſide that they can have but for a Seaſon the enjoyment of any thing beneath the Sun; For, this according to the Preachers Scope, may be alſo looked upon, as a conſideration to wean the hearts of men from ſeeking Happineſs in things below, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe under heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Gods providence reacheth not only to all Events and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes within the Church, where it is in a moſt ſpecial way exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1. but to all the corners of the Earth, and to Hell alſo; Neither Men, nor Devils, Heathens, or Infidels, can act or plot againſt Him, or his bleſsed People, but at the Seaſon and Times, wherein it ſhall prove fitteſt for His Glory, and the good of His Own: For, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. One and the ſame Truth may have ſeveral Uſes drawn from it; For, as this that there is a Seaſon and Time for every thing fore-appointed by God, ſerves to quiet the hearts of the Godly, and make them careful to obſerve the Time; ſo as it imports many changes in Time; It ſerves to wean mens hearts from things Earthlie, which can be enjoyed but for a Time.</p>

                  <p>In this and the following <hi>Verſes,</hi> the Preacher giveth many particular inſtances, wherein the Truth of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Lords fixing of the Time and Seaſon of every Event under the Sun, is mainly to be conſidered, and made uſe of; And however ſome of theſe inſtances have a Truth in them in reference to mans Duty, that there is a fit Seaſon for him to do ſuch and ſuch things in, which he ought to obſerve and make uſe of; as is clear by inſtances of Mourning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, Silence, and Speech; Yet all of them are mainly and the moſt part of them only, to be underſtood, in reference to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51442:75"/>
the Lords fixing of the time of their being, and conſequently the manner thereof: Nor are theſe inſtances to be taken for a full enumeration, as if every thing, the time whereof is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord, were here reckoned out, and no other thing but what is here particularly named were to be looked upon, as having its Time and Seaſon fixed; But the purpoſe ſpoken of, is to be underſtood of theſe and ſuch like, which clauſe is to be underſtood after them all, ſeeing it is elſe where expreſt in Scripture after ſuch Enumerations. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. Only theſe are to be looked upon as the prime Diſpenſations of God in the World, and mainly uſeful to be conſidered, as they are timed, and ordered by His Providence; and being ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are fit to work the Hearts of the Godly to Contentment under all changes, and to wean the hearts of all from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs in this life; where ſuch variety of changes are; And they are put in pairs, as deſerving a joint conſideration, that when the one is called to mind, the other, which is in ſome ſort contrary to it, may alſo come to mind:</p>
                  <p>The firſt Pair concerning the time of Birth and Death, is literally to be underſtood. That the very minut of every ones entry into this World, whether it be timely or abortive; and likewiſe of their departure out of it by Death, whether natural, or violent is from Eternity fixed, and cannot fall out ſooner or later than God hath appointed. The other, concerning the Times of <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>plucking up,</hi> though they have in them a Truth in reference to mans Duty, who ought to obſerve the time of ſuch actions as may be held out under theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions whether properly or metaphorically taken; yet they are mainly to be underſtood of Gods Diſpenſation about Man along his life, between his Birth and Death, and particularly of his Planting and ſetling Nations and Churches and particular mens intereſts therein, which are pointed at in the following Inſtances, and his overturning the ſame again, when he ſees fit and that becauſe the Scripture doth frequently expreſs theſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51442:75"/>
particular Diſpenſations of Providence, in the very ſame Terms that are here, both in Threatnings <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.4. and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes <hi>Jer,</hi> 24.6. and 31.28. and likewiſe becauſe theſe are the Diſpenſations wherewith the hearts of the Godly are moſt diſquieted, and therefore to look upon them, as Timed, and ordered wiſely by the Lord ſerves much for quieting of them, which is the Scope.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. It is not enough for Miniſters to hold out clear and ſound Truths in the general, but they muſt alſo take pains to reckon out, and inſiſt upon particular inſtances, wherein the Truth of what they deliver is verified, that ſo the Lords People by the ordinary occurences of His Providence, and Diſpenſations with them, may be minded of what they have heard, and in theſe may ſee the Truth of the ſame: For here, this Divine Preacher, worthy to be imitate by all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, being guided by the Spirit of the Lord, doth not think it enough to hold out that Truth, That there is a ſeaſon and ſet time, for every thing and purpoſe, and ſo leave it to People to apply the ſame to the particular paſſages of Gods providence along their life; but for their help He condeſcends upon twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight particular Diſpenſations, the Times and Seaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſet and fixed. <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to dy; a time to plant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As their will ſtill be variety of Changes, and a mixture of Sour and Sweet in the Lords Diſpenſations with the Children of men in this Life, it being proper for the other Life to be without any change or mixture, ſo the conſideration of the better and worſe thereof ought to be joined in our thoughts, and the one ſet againſt the other, that what is comfortable, may be poſſeſt humbly, thankfully, and with preparation for a change, and what is ſad may be ſubmitted unto, ſince we have had ſweeter, and may have hope of a change to the better again, Therefore are theſe pairs or couples of inſtances made up of ſadder and ſweeter Diſpenſations, as that which is the Lot of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51442:76"/>
men in this Life, and which ought jointly to be conſidered for our uſe. <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to dy, a time to plant, and a time to pluck up</hi> that which <hi>is planted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe Events which are moſt certain to us, as to the ordinary time of their exiſtence, and theſe alſo, which being altogether uncertain, for the particular time of them, and are yet certainly known to fall out, are ordinarly moſt ſlighted by us, as to the conſideration of the Lords timing of them, and yet would be moſt uſef <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for us to conſider; For here the time of Birth, which ordinarly after the Conception is certainly known; and the time of Death, which though it be unknown, is moſt certainly known as to the futurition of it, are firſt condeſcended upon, as things we do moſt readily ſlight, and things moſt uſeful to be conſidered, as they fall under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Providence for the time of them, <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to dy:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The particular time of every ones entry into the World, hath been from Eternity fixed, and condeſcended upon by the Lord, and the ſame ought to be ſeriouſly conſidered by all that are born of Women, both in Reference to their own Birth, and others, eſpecially theſe who are Born to them, that they may look upon all the comfortable paſſages of Providence, which they come to underſtand, as encouragments to ſerve the Lord, and upon all the ſad paſſages they have met with, as theſe whereunto they are Born, and which therefore they ſhould indure patiently <hi>Job,</hi> 14.1.

So the period of every mans Life, and conſequently the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Death, is fore-determined by the Lord; The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, as it ought not to make any careleſs of the uſe of lawful means for prolonging their Life, that they may do God Service in their Generation, ſo it ought to be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded by the Godly for guarding their hearts againſt the fear of Death from men, who ſeek their Life for their fidelity to Chriſt <hi>Pſal.</hi>

And ſometimes again to manifeſt His Mercy to His Own, By ſuffering them to be killed unjuſtly by men, and ſo haſting them home to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Mark</hi> 6.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.2. So the particular time of all ſuch ſad events as theſe, hath been wiſely reſolved upon by the Lord from all Eternity, and no creature can bring them on ſooner, or hold them off longer then He hath determined; None can Kill before, and none can eſcape the ſtroake after His ſet times comes; for in reference to the Lords fixing of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch Diſpenſations, here ſignified by <hi>Killing,</hi> is this Inſtance to be underſtood <hi>There is a time to kill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Lord is pleaſed to deal in ſuch ſeverity with the Children of men, as to their own ſenſe their caſe is as deſperat, as if He were killing and ſlaying them <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24. and to the apprehenſion of others, as if they were really Killed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22. while yet He intends not to deſtroy, or make an end of them, but to reſtore them to their former condition: For this Killing may be taken both in reference to theſe that are Healed, and to others. <hi>There is a time to kill, and a time to heal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Times of Healing, whether of Bleeding and ſick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of rent and diſtempered Churches, or wounded Spirits, are in Gods Hand, and till His time come, all eſſays of other Phyſicians for Healing are in vain; and therefore He is to be humbly employed, and depended upon for that end, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that however times of Healing be fixed with Him, yet the importunity of penitents is ordinarly a comfortable fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their being healed 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 7.14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1. For, with Him, <hi>There is a time to heal.</hi>

                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51442:82"/>4. The Lord uſes to manifeſt moſt of His skill about theſe diſeaſes which the wiſeſt Phyſicians among men would think incurable, He can not only <hi>Heal</hi> after wounding, but after Killing, by giving a better life and health than hath been taken away, eſpecially when it is for His ſake. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.39. <hi>There is a time to kill, and a time to heal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The thoughts of this, that the Lord hath the Times of <hi>Killing</hi> and <hi>Healing</hi> in His hand, may bring much quietneſs and contentment of Spirit, under all changes of Diſpenſations, to theſe who ſeek their Happineſs in His favour and fellowſhip, conſidering that, whatever be the power, or malice of men, they cannot <hi>Kill</hi> when they pleaſe, and though they ſhould be permitted to <hi>Kill,</hi> he hath a time for <hi>Healing</hi> again; And the ſame may ſerve alſo to divorce mens Hearts from theſe things wherein they ſeek their Happineſs beſide the Lord, if they conſider that He can eaſily Kill and Deſtroy all that go a Whoreing from Him; For it is ſafe and uſeful to referr all theſe Inſtances which the Spirit of the Lord enumerats, to the Scope in hand, which is both to guard the Hearts of the Godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vexation, under ſad, and terrible Diſpenſations, and to deterre all from exceſs of delight in things earthly, <hi>There is a time to kill, and a time to heal.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. No mans outward Eſtate or Worldly Enjoyments of what ſort ſoever they be, are ſo firmly ſetled, but the Lord can eaſily when He pleaſes, break all down; and therefore men ſhould look upon their Buildings, whether for their Credit, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Worldly profit, as unworthy to have their heart, ſeeing the Lord hath a time ſixed to break them down, and the whole univerſe alſo, and ſhould ſeek to have themſelves Built upon the Rock, which no ſtorme can overthrow, <hi>There is a time to break down.</hi>

                  <p>WE have here the effects of the former Diſpenſations, upon the Spirits, and carriage of men, the timing whereof is aſſerted to be in the hand of God, no leſs than the Diſpenſations themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And for the underſtanding of theſe, and the time of them, it would be conſidered firſt, That this <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> here ſpoken of, cannot be underſtood of Worldly Sorrow which cauſeth Death 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 10. And conſequently the <hi>Laughter</hi> here ſpoken of, is not to be underſtood of Carnal Mirth, or the expreſſions thereof, which the Lord hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with much woe <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.25. Eſpecially when His Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations call to Mourning <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.13.14. Nor is this <hi>Dancing</hi> meant of the the laſcivious carriage of men at Feaſts <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.22. Or Idolatrous Worſhip. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32 19. For, though the Lord, give up men to the former, as a ſad puniſhment of their ſins, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.16. And leave them to the other as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of further Judgment <hi>Amos</hi> 6.5. Yet there is no time allowed in the Word of God for ſuch things: And therefore they are mainly to be underſtood of moderate grief and and Godly ſorrow, with the expreſſions thereof, ſuitable to the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Killing, breaking down</hi> &amp;c. formerly mentioned, and of lawful Mirth, and ſpiritual rejoycing ſuitable to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of <hi>Healing, and Building up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, That the difference between the firſt two Inſtances and the laſt, is only (according to the force of the Words in in the Original) in meaſure and degree, for though all of them ſignifie the outward expreſſion of theſe paſſions of grief and joy, yet Weeping is that which is more moderate, expreſſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51442:83"/>
by ſighs and tears, Mourning again, according to the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word, is that degree of grief, which hath higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions than the former, ſuch as ſmiting of the breaſt, and the like. The <hi>Laughter</hi> here ſpoken of is joy appearing in the countenance, and voice only. And <hi>Dancing</hi> is that which is expreſt by the whole outward man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the time of theſe paſſions or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, here ſpoken of, is both to be underſtood in reference to the Lords Diſpenſations, and likewiſe to mans Duty, and the Lords putting him to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Lord hath ſet times wherin He giveth matter and occaſion of Grief or Joy, more or leſs in His Diſpenſations, ſo it is Peoples Duty to obſerve when and in what meaſure, His Word, and Diſpenſations call them to expreſs the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That however theſe inſtances be applicable to all men, who live under ſuch change of Diſpenſations, yet it is ſafeſt to apply them in ſpecial, to the Church and People of God, among whom the Diſpenſations formerly mentioned are mainly remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The Lord hath the ſad and mournfull times of People ſet and fixed from Eternity, when He ſees it fit ſo to work, that they ſhall have much matter of Mourning, and when He intends to frame their ſpirits for it, by ſuſpending comfort, or by pouring out the ſpirit of Grace and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication that they may be prepared for comfort here, and may long for the time when tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes <hi>There is a time to weep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are degrees of the ſad conditions of the Godly, He doth not alwayes give them alike matter of Grief, nor when they have, doth He ſuffer their hearts to be alike weighted therewith, for the One of theſe Words doth expreſs a higher degree of Grief, than the Other, <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to mourn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The World, and all the comforts of it, can neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51442:83"/>
nor mitigate the Mourning and Grief of People, when the Lord ſees it fit to exerciſe them therewith: Nor can men bring it on, for all their malice and power, till the Lords ſett time come, which is here ſpoken of, <hi>There is a time to mourn, and a time to weep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the Duty of the Lords People to obſerve the time, when He by His Word, and Diſpenſations calls them to Mourn and Weep, that they may rationally and willingly apply their hearts to that exerciſe, it being a high provocation of Him, and a forerunner of much woe to them, not to Mourn and Weep when he calls them to it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.12. For this may be alſo underſtood of the time to be obſerved, and made uſe of by His people <hi>There is a time to mourn, and a time to weep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is ſometimes neceſſary for the Lords people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when there is much terrour in His Diſpenſations of <hi>kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, plucking up, and breaking down,</hi> formerly mentioned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Grief ſo as it may appear to others, by their abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and chaſtening of their fleſh <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.2, 3. by their humble walking <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.15. For the Words, as was cleared in the Expoſition, ſignifie ſuch ſorrow, as breaks out in ſignes and expreſſions, ſo as it cannot be hid, <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to mourn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord hath alſo His own times ſet and fixed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will fill the mouths of his People with Laughter, and turn their Mourning into Dancing, by making them ſee the performance of theſe promiſes which they could hardly believe <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.6. Healing their ſpiritual diſtempers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.5, 6. Guarding their hearts againſt the vexation of affliction, <hi>Job,</hi> 5.22. giving them ſuch clear foreſights, and ſweet foretaſtes, of their future Happineſs, that they cannot but skip for joy, even in the midſt of the worſt that men can do to them <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.23. And ſometimes by giving them deliverance from their troubles <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2. And when His time for making His People Laugh and Dance cometh, the World cannot hinder it; For <hi>There is a time to laugh and to dance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:51442:84"/>7. It is the Duty of the Lords People, eſpecially when His Diſpenſations are eminently comfortable, to make conſcience of rejoicing, and of expreſſing the ſame in their words, and carriage, by their chearful walking, running the way of His Commandements, and inciting others to His praiſe, for this concerning the time of Laughter and Dancing, is alſo to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in reference to our Duty, that the Time of His Healing, Building, and Planting formerly ſpoken of, is to be obſerved and made uſe of by His People, who ſhould then expreſs their joy, as the Words ſignify, <hi>There is a time to laugh and a time to dance.</hi>

                  <p>THe firſt Two of theſe Inſtances, concerning the Time of <hi>Casting away and Gathering ſtones,</hi> may be taken for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial kind of ſpeech, made uſe of 1. To ſignifie the Duty of dependance upon Gods Providence, and acknowledgment of Him, who hath the timing of mens undertakings, even their ſmalleſt matters in His hand. 2dly. The expedience of mens obſerving according to the revealed will of God, the fitteſt ſeaſons for their Actions. And 3. To check and reprove the folly of men who ſlight Him, and the obſervation of theſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons even in their ſmalleſt matters. They may be alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the time of mens preparing materialls for any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, as minding them, that they are ſo under dominion of Gods Providence, that he can in His time, make them undo what they have formerly done, and either of theſe ways, the ſenſe is ſubſervient to the ſcope to make men conſtant in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, and acknowledgment of Him, who hath the Time of all Events in His hand, and doth direct men to time their undertakings aright.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51442:84"/>As for the other two, concerning the time of <hi>Embracing</hi> and refraining therefrom, they are to be underſtood of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of love, whether from the Lord to His people, which he gives and withholds only in His Own Times <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.6, Or among His People themſelves <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. It is ſafe to comprehend both, ſeing the Scriptures cited expreſs both in ſuch termes, and both are agreeable to the Scope, for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart to ſubmiſſion under the changes of His Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whoſe love is conſtant, and to teach men Dependence upon Him for direction when to expreſs their love to others, and when to refrain therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Men ought not only to depend upon God, as the carver out of the times of their more weighty undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and theſe which ſeem to them of greateſt concernment in the World; and to obſerve carefully the right timing of theſe; but they ought to do the ſame in the ſmalleſt matters, For even of ſuch may theſe inſtances be underſtood, and ſo taken literally, God muſt be looked unto even in ſuch things as theſe, <hi>There is a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather ſtones together:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men are imployed in preparing materials for any of their Enterprizes in this World, they ſhould conſider that they are ſo under the dominion of Gods Providence, that He may ſoon make them meet with the time when they ſhall be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to undoe what they have done of that kind, that ſo they may keep their hearts from exceſs of delight in Worldly things; For this leſſon makes to <hi>Solomons</hi> Scope, and ſo is intended by theſe inſtances <hi>There is a time to gather ſtones, and a time to caſt them away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord hath His Own times ſet, for Embracing of, or manifeſting His favour to His People, by His ſpirit, clearing to them the work of His Grace 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. Strengthening their faith to Embrace the promiſes <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. And ſo <hi>filling them with joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1.8. Which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51442:85"/>
ſeaſons though they be abſolutely in His own Power, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly known to Him alone, yet doth His People ordinarly meet with them, when they are moſt deeply humbled in the ſenſe of their ſins <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.3. when they are under ſaddeſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, eſpecially for His name <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. And when they have been at the ſoreſt battel to maintain the faith of His love, while they wanted the ſenſe of it <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.18.20. For in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Lords Diſpenſations with His People, may this be underſtood, <hi>There is a time to embrace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though the Lord never ceaſe to love His own <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1· yet doth he ſee it fit ſometimes to reſtrain Himſelf from the manifeſtations, and expreſſions of His love, that they may be corrected and humbled for undervaluing the ſame, and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to greater diligence in ſeeking after new manifeſtations thereof <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3.6. For with the Lord alſo <hi>There is a time to refrain from embracing</hi> of His People.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As there are ſeaſons to be obſerved and made uſe of, for expreſſing of our affection to others, ſuch as the time of their diſtreſs, and deep affliction 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16. and when they are ready to be diſcouraged by Jealouſies of our affection to them <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. So upon the other hand, there are times of refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from, and keeping up theſe expreſſions, even when love it ſelf is intertained, as when our refraining ſerves to humble others for their former unkindneſs to us, or when we have ground to think they will make a bad uſe of the expreſſions of our reſpect <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.31. In which and the like caſes <hi>There is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.</hi>

And <hi>lastly,</hi> The Time of Caſting away is not to be underſtood, as if men at any time ſhould take on voluntary Poverty, but that there is a Time fixed wherein Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls men, not only to ſubmit to loſe, but voluntarily and chearfully, to part with all they have, in the caſes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. As it is lawful and neceſſary for men to make uſe of opportunities of getting or purchaſing things Worldly, providing they ſeek no more than a competency <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. that they ſeek things heavenly in the firſt place <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.33. And that they take the time and means approven for that end, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.26. So ought they even when they are ſo getting, or purchaſing to depend upon the Lord as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeaſon thereof in His hand, and who can eaſily diſſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them, when they have moſt promiſing opportunities of getting gain <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.13.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51442:86"/>
Earthly things, and no more choice them for their portion, but ſeek after a better and more durable ſubſtance; So even while men have proſperous times of Getting, they ought to think upon Times of Loſing theſe things and ſo looſe their hearts from them; For, as <hi>There is a time to get, ſo, there is a time to loſe.</hi>
                  </p>

againſt men; by marring their peace, and Union among themſelves, or by Renting them from their Enjoyments: And at another time fore-appointed by Him, He heals theſe diviſions again, and that becauſe the word <hi>Renting</hi> is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in ſcripture in this ſenſe, (but never to expreſs any thing of mans Duty) and the Metaphore or ſimilitude which is in it from the Renting of a Garment, is made uſe of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſly to ſet forth ſuch a Diſpenſation 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.27. Both which, <hi>viz.</hi> The inflicting of theſe Rents, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Sewing, or Healing of them as a favour, are here aſſerted to be in Gods Hand for the Timing of them; As for the other Two of <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> They are mainly to be underſtood in reference to Mans Duty of obſerving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of theſe, as contributing much for his own Peace, and preventing his own and others vexation; Becauſe under the like expreſſions the Scripture elswhere preſſeth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the tongue for that ſame end, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The Lord hath a Holy Hand in the Rents and Diviſions that are among men, and hath the time of exerciſing them therewith ſet, and fixed, whereby He intends to correct and humble them, for their not adhering to Him and His way, and often to make way for ſome further ſtroake to be inflicted upon them, thereby weakning them before their common enemy, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 9.21.

The fourth is, That Gods end in this variety of Diſpenſations, is good, to wit, That man ſhould be exerciſed therein, to keep him from ſetling upon this Earth, as if Happineſs could be, where ſo many ups and downs are, or, that he may be humbled thereby (as the Word <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,</hi> moſt properly, and according to the moſt frequent uſe of it in Scripture, ſignifies) <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>

Gods great End in all the various Changes of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from Comforts to Croſſes, and on the contrary, is to keep man in exerciſe; that under the ſweeteſt he may think it his Duty to be exerciſed in Praiſe, and in preparation for ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And under the ſaddeſt, to be exerciſed in Prayer, and the uſe of other means for ſupport, direction and comfort; and ſo may be alwiſe buſie: For, if men were ſtill under ſad Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, they would ſink in diſcouragement <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.16.

                  <p>THe Fifth Conſideration ſerving to work the hearts of men to contentment under various changes, of Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations is, <hi>That God hath made every thing beautiful in its ſeaſon,</hi> Though this have a truth as to the Works of Creation, every one whereof hath its own beauty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.13. And likewiſe as theſe actions which are moſt deformed in the hands of men, ſeeing even theſe as they are in Gods hand, and ordered by His Providence, have their own beauty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. Yet it is mainly to be underſtood of theſe Divine Diſpenſations, or Works of Providence formerly mentioned: not only theſe of them which are moſt deſirable to men, ſuch as <hi>Planting, building up, healing, peace</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>plucking up, breaking down, killing, war</hi> &amp;c. have a beauty in them to a ſpiritual diſcerner, who can find out by the light of the Word, and Spirit, the Mind of God in theſe, and ſee them brought to paſs by His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſeaſons fitteſt for attaining His ends; and can read theſe attributes of His Wiſdom, Power, Love, and the like which are written upon them, and ſo they are worthy to draw mens hearts to delight in the conſideration of them, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſubmit to them.</p>
                  <p>And if it be inquired how it comes to paſs, that the moſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51442:95"/>
part of men do not ſee this beauty; and ſo do not willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto, but vex themſelves and repine at theſe ſad Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of His; The Preacher giveth Two Reaſons hereof. 1. The Lord hath ſet the World in their heart, that is, He hath juſtly left their hearts to be wholly taken up with their gain, Glory, and pleaſure Worldly; ſeeing they choiſe theſe things for their portion: And hence it comes, which is the Second reaſon; that they cannot find out His work, that is His mind in His Diſpenſations by comparing one of them with another, and looking upon them all as one intire piece of work in His hand, Therefore they ſee not the beauty of them, and do not chearfully ſubmit unto them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Not only the Works of Creation have a luſtre and beauty in them, in ſo far as the Glorious Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, and other Attributes of the Creator, ſhine in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. But even theſe Works of Providence which ſeem blackeſt unto men, have a great deal of raviſhing beauty: <hi>Joſephs</hi> being ſold, <hi>Job</hi> ſpoiled and plagued, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, Chriſt betrayed, and nailed upon the Croſs; Theſe and the like, although being looked upon as in the hand of inſtruments, they ſeem to have nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in them, yet being looked upon, as Gods Workes, and according to His intent, and the reſult of them, they have a raviſhing beauty in them, and many of His fair Attributes written upon them; For, ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However we would have our tryals delayed longer, and our deliverances coming ſooner, than they do, yet theſe and all other Diſpenſations of the Lord fall out in their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, and in the ſeaſon which is fitteſt for them, and the obſerving of them, as wiſely timed, and trifted with the fitteſt opportunity they could have fallen out in, doth ſerve much to diſcover the luſtre and Beauty of them, For, <hi>He hath made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verything beautiful in his time,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:51442:95"/>3. It is the ſight of the beauty that is in Divine Diſpenſations, and the Obſervation of the fitneſs of the ſeaſon wherein they fall out, that makes men chearfully ſubmit to them, ſo that when we murmure at, and weary of Diſpenſations, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee not the beauty that is in them, or do not look upon them, as falling out in the ſeaſon fitteſt for them, For, this is a conſideration held out, to quiet and comfort the hearts of men, under ſad Diſpenſations, <hi>That he hath made every thing beautiful in his time,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although the Lord be free of mens ſin, and doth nothing to induce them to any thing contrary to His Will <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. yet when men contrary to His revealed Will, and their own light, choiſe the things of this earth for their portion, He doth juſtly give them up to ſerve their idols, arid (though they do not injoy them, yet) to pour out their deſires and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon them, for it is of Gods Judicial giving up of men to ſerve their Worldly luſts, who have choſen the ſame for their Portion, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks, while he ſaith, <hi>He hath ſee the World in their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Men that are exceſſivly in love with Mammon, or any thing Worldly, whoſe prime deſire is to obtain, their fears to loſe, and delights to enjoy the ſame, they can never diſcern the beauty, that is in the Lords Diſpenſations, they are ſo bent upon the ſervice of their idols that they have neither leaſure, nor pleaſure, to ſtudy His mind in His working; for after the Preacher hath aſſerted every thing that God doth to be <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his time,</hi> he giveth this for a reaſon why men ſee not that beauty, <hi>The World is ſet in their heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6, The Beauty of Divine Diſpenſations, which makes them lovely, and makes men ſubmit unto, and chearfully undergo them, cannot be ſeen, till one part of Gods working, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with another, and the whole, ſo far as mans mind can reach, viewed at once, by going back in his mind as far as he can, toward Eternity, to conſider the Lords foreknowledge
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51442:96"/>
of theſe things, His Holy purpoſes and ends in them, ſo far as the Word manifeſts theſe <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18. And comparing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theſe fair properties of God, His Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice and Mercy, which are legibly writen upon them in time, by the help of the Scriptures <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2, 3, 4. And by the ſame help looking foreward to Eternity, and conſidering what ſhall be the iſſue and reſult of all theſe Diſpenſations, even Glory to Himſelf in the manifeſtation of His Terrour to the wicked, of his mercy and love to His Own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. For, this is a Second Reaſon, why the Beauty of Diſpenſations is not ſeen, <hi>man finds not out his work from the beginning to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though an unrenewed man may ſometimes ſee further into Gods mind, and conſequently into the beauty of ſome of His Diſpenſations, than a renewed Child of God, while he is under a Cloud of Temptations, can do; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3. And however the beſt of men can never in this life comprehenſively find out any of Gods Works, or know what may be known of them, yet theſe that are moſt mortified to the World, and whoſe hearts are moſt free of cares and delights, about the things thereof, they are fitteſt to ſee furtheſt into Gods Works; For if the <hi>World ſet in mens hearts,</hi> be the cauſe why they cannot find out the Work of God from the beginning to the end, although they may ſee ſomething in ſome particular Work of His, than they that have it not in their heart, muſt have a fair advantage of them for finding out the ſame <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end.</hi>

                  <p>THe Sixth Conſideration ſerving to wean mens hearts from the beſt condition they can be in in this World, as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51442:96"/>
their Chief Good, is, That the moſt favourable of the Lords outward Diſpenſations, have no further good in them to man, than to incourage him in following of his Duty to his Maker, and ſo fit him for a better life.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why we take <hi>Solomon</hi> here to ſpeak eſpecially of favourable Diſpenſations, is, that the Duties here commended are mainly ſuitable to theſe; and men living under theſe, are in the fitteſt Capacity for ſuch Duties.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of them is, That from the Lords bounty and goodneſs manifeſted in his favourable Diſpenſations, men ſhould draw matter of ſpiritual Joy, and chear up his heart in God <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he ſhould expreſs the ſame by his activity in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing commanded Duties, and what is well pleaſing in the ſight of God, and perſevere in the ſame while he hath any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is <hi>To do good in his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 3. That in order to the former <hi>Two,</hi> he ſhould freely uſe the lawful outward comforts of this life comprehended under Eating and Drinking; Whereby muſt be meant only the Sober and Holy Uſe of the Creatures, ſeeing that only is conſiſtent with, and ſubſervient to ſpiritual Joy, and doing good formerly preſt; and this Uſe of favourable Diſpenſations he preſſes by Two Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe ſo man ſhall injoy the good of his Labour, that is, he ſhall have a temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all his pains and toil in his Duty, even that which is truely good in order to a higher, the injoying of fellowſhip with God, while he is making thoſe Uſes formerly expreſt of the Lords favourable Diſpenſations, And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe this, to wit, the Power and Grace to uſe theſe outward comforts chearfully, and as incouragements in ſerving the giver, is a free gift of God, over and above the favours themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. While the Lord deals favourably with men in His outward Diſpenſations, they are very prone to miſtake the good that is in their condition, and to apprehend ſome
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51442:97"/>
greater Happineſs therein, than they have ground, by taking their preſent ſweetneſs for their chief good, and the outmoſt that is to be deſired <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. And rejoicing more in the ſame than in the Giver <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.14. Therefore the Wiſe-man doth not poſitively and ſimply aſſert the right uſe of theſe favourable Diſpenſations, but finds it neceſſary to deny that there is any other good deſervedly ſo called in things of that nature, than what is here pointed at; and confirms the ſame by oppoſing his own certain Knowledge and Experience to other mens Fancies. <hi>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. However the Lords People want not matter of rejoicing in their ſaddeſt condition 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Nor of Humiliation in their beſt in this life <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. Yet when the Lord is dealing bountifully with them even in His outward Diſpenſations, they are then in a ſpecial manner called to ſpiritual Joy, whereby they comfort themſelves in Him as theirs, more than in His favours <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13.14. And go chearfully about His ſervice <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.5. This being the end of all His Liberality <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.10.11. And that which is mainly expected from them by others of His People <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.7. For Spiritual Joy, as the principal Duty of one living under favourable Diſpenſations, is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. <hi>There is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the chearfulneſs and recreation of ſpirit that men get by the comfortable Paſſages of Gods Providence toward them, ſhould incite them to well-doing, eſpecially to Duties relating to the Lords publick Work in the World. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.16. Duties of Equity and Righteouſneſs in their dealings with men, that when their hearts are cheared and lifted up with favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Providences they turn not to injuſtice and oppreſſion <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. And Duties of Charity and Beneficence to the poor and afflicted that are not ſo well dealt with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. All which the Scriptures cited make clear to be that doing good in Gods ſight which is here recommended as that whereby ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and chearfulneſs ought to be evidenced; <hi>There is no
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51442:97"/>
good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and do good in his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. None can do any thing which is truely good in Gods ſight, unleſs he have firſt ſome meaſure of ſpiritual Joy, in God, flowing from the faith of acceptation with Him thorow Chriſt, which only begets true Joy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.2. And this Joy becomes the Souls ſtrength for every Duty <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10, Therefore the Preacher expreſſes the right uſe of the Lords favourable Diſpenſations in this order, that man ſhould firſt <hi>Rejoyce, and then do good in his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They whoſe Hearts are cheared, by the proofs of the Lords bountie in His dealing with them, and do expreſs that chearfulneſs by their activity in Duties that may honour Him, they have found that true good which is attainable in this life; And when men either take not the comforts allowed upon them, or do not expreſs and evidence the ſame by well-doing, they get no good of their greateſt Mercies, but much hurt; For this muſt be the only true Good, which men can attain by all the comfortable Paſſages of Gods Providence in their Life, ſeeing as the Wiſe-man ſaith, <hi>There is no good in them, but that a man ſhould rejoice and do good in his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is no ſhorter term of doing good, than the term of Life, nor is there any part of a mans Life to be otherwiſe employed, whereunto he ſhould be ingadged by conſidering that he will not have after this Life, opportunity or advantage to do good, as he hath here, by gaining and allureing others to Duty toward God; For, ſo ſaith the Preacher. <hi>That a man ſhould do good in his Life,</hi> to wit, along his whole time,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Although the Creature comforts are alwiſe to be uſed in a Holy and ſober manner 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4.5. And never as fewel to mens Luſts <hi>Deut,</hi> 6.11, 12. yet when the Lord is dealing more Liberally with men in outward things than at other times, he doth allow a more liberal, and chearfull uſe of the Creatures upon them, that ſo they may be the more ſtrengthned and incouraged for theſe weighty Duties which are ſuitable for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51442:98"/>
ſuch Diſpenſations; For, ſeeing it is Gods allowance alwayes while he continues life, and the uſe of the Creatures for the maintainance thereof, that men ſhould <hi>Eat and Drink;</hi> This Eating and Drinking here recommended, muſt be meant of a more free and chearful uſe of theſe things, under His more favourable Diſpenſations, eſpecially conſidering that it muſt be ſubſervient to the former Two, Rejoicing, and <hi>Doing good, And alſo that every man ſhould eat and drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Although the Lord may give to his People abundance of outward things for which they have not laboured, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11. Yet it is His mind that every one who takes the comfort of the Creatures ſhould be imployed in ſome honeſt lawful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, while they have Ability, whereof their Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be the fruit of reward, for while man Eats and Drinks he ſhould be enjoying <hi>the good of his Labour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. When men uſe the comfort of the Creatures, ſuch as Meat, Drink, and the like, and are thereby cheared in their hearts, and encouraged in Duty to God, then, and never but then, do they <hi>enjoy the good of their Labour,</hi> Without this their table is but a ſnare to them; For, this Enjoying the good of a mans Labour is brought in as the reſult of what is before. <hi>That a man rejoice and do good and eat and drink, and ſo injoy the good of his Labour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Not only the plenty of Creature comforts, and the power to uſe them; but eſpecially the Grace to uſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; by drawing matter of ſpiritual Joy from them, and incitement to Duty, is Gods ſpecial Gift, which ſhould be thankfully ackowledged by men, while they uſe them, And not taken as the Beaſts do, without minding the Giver: For, all the former, to wit, Creature comforts, the Power to uſe them, and to Rejoice, and Do Good, are here called <hi>The gift of God.</hi> And this is held out as a Reaſon why men ſhould take their allowance and uſe it as hath been ſhown.</p>

of affairs, in former times, and by the light of the ſpirit of Propheſy, revealing to him what was to be expected ordinarily to fall out, to wit that in Courts of Juſtice, and Judgement Seats, where Natures light, Gods Word, and Poor peoples Caſe, call for Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhould be paſt againſt wickedneſs and injuſtice, and in favours of Piety and Equity, even there, nothing but the quit contrary oftentimes is to be found: and to ſignify the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this evil, and the frequency or generality of it, he uſeth two expreſſions to the ſame purpoſe, for ſetting it out Ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>Next, he holds forth to others that conſideration which guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart againſt the vexation which ſuch a ſight doth readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work; And this makes the <hi>Twelfth</hi> in number, to wit, that God will paſs righteous Judgement, both upon the Righteous or them that have a good cauſe, by abſolving them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging their wrongs; And upon the wicked by reverſing their unjuſt ſentences, and puniſhing them for paſſing of them.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>thridly</hi> to make this conſideration the more effectual, he inlarges it, by ſhowing that there is a ſet or fixed time, as the Word ſignifies, <hi>there,</hi> to wit, with God, or at the day of Judgement, for Judging men as well for their wicked purpoſes, and intentions, as for their wicked Actions; So that the one verſe ſerves to wean mens hearts from leeking Happineſs in this World, ſeeing injuſtice and oppreſſion is ſo ordinary in it.

As it is the pleaſure of the only wiſe God, to permit men void of true piety, to have have Power and Authority in the World, that all may know there is no True Happineſs in things of that nature; and that they are not proofs of His love, ſo ſuch men when they get power and high places, do ordinarily abuſe the ſame to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice

                  <p n="2">2 It is a great aggravation of mens ſins to be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the prime Duties of their calling, and committed in the place where the Graces or Duties to which thoſe ſins are contrary, ought to be exerciſed; For, as an aggravation of this ſin of injuſtice, <hi>Solomon</hi> points at the place where it was committed, and conſequently the prime Duty of their calling, to which it was contrary <hi>I ſaw under the ſun the place of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that wickedneſs was there; and the place of righteouſneſs that iniquity was there.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. This is one of the Holy Deſignes of God in permitting Wicked men to have that power and theſe places of truſt in the World, which they abuſe by oppreſſion, and Injuſtice, that they may manifeſt that Wickedneſs which was before latent in them, hid from the World, and themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, while they had not ſuch opportunity and Temptations to vent it. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.13.

And likewiſe it ſhould make Men in the firſt place Study the mortification of theſe Evils, which great places often diſcover, to the diſgrace and ruine of the Perſons advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; For upon this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith he did meditate as Gods purpoſe and deſign in permitting that which he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former verſe. <hi>I ſaid in mine heart concerning the eſtate of the ſons of men, that God might manifeſt them,</hi> that is, that it was his purpoſe to let them ſhow what they were.</p>

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The Spirits of Men are Immortal, and after ſeparation from the Body have a ſubſiſtence; For, having told that Mens Bodies return to the Duſt, as the Beaſts do, he ſpeaks of their Spirits, as yet exiſting, and moving upward, <hi>who knows the ſpirit of man that goes upward.</hi>

them; And ſo conſequently this rejoicing in a Mans <hi>own Work,</hi> is not to be underſtood in oppoſition to Rejoicing in the Lord, but to Rejoicing in what is ſinful, or unſuitable for Reaſonable Creatures, and marrs the comfortable uſe of what they have thorow the Bleſſing of God, upon their own induſtry and pains, attained unto, and their chearful following of their Duty to Him, which is here commended. And this he preſſeth by Two Reaſons, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this is a Mans Portion; Which is not to be underſtood as if this were the furtheſt or ſweeteſt that man hath to expect, ſeeing that never entered into his heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. But as it is the Lords allowance to Man, a temporary reward of his Labour, and the beſt recompence of his pains that he is capable of in this World. The <hi>Second</hi> is, That when a Man ſhall (as of neceſſity he muſt, which is implyed here) leave all behind him, there is no poſſibility of his returning to ſee, or (as the Word may be rendered) to Enjoy, any of theſe outward Comforts, which is the force of this Queſtion; and therefore it is his beſt to uſe all, as incouragments to a chearful following of his Duty to God.</p>
                  <p>From this we may Learn. 1. That all the Exerciſes of Mens wit, in the diſcourſes of their mind, and meditation upon the Lords Diſpenſations, ought alwayes to reſolve in ſome practical Concluſion, for engadging their hearts to ſuch Exerciſes of Piety and Holineſs, as many honour the Lord; and to chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in going about theſe, elſe our contemplations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, though never ſo clear and ſatisfactory, are vain and fruitleſs, in order to the promoving of our True Happineſs: For, here <hi>Solomon</hi> from his former Obſervations, which he had painfully gathered by much meditation, for clearing of his own and others minds, concerning the Lords Diſpenſations, draweth this practical concluſion, whereby he commends to his own heart and others, a chearful going about of Commanded Duties for the honour of God. <hi>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Although the full reward of Well-doing be reſerved for the other Life; yet there is ſome portion, or part of it (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>let out</hi> in the mean time; ſo much as may make Men hold chearfully on in their duty under the ſaddeſt Diſpenſations they may meet with, even that Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and Peace that paſſeth Underſtanding, from their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the Lords enabling them to follow their duty, and of His acceptance of them and it: For, ſaith <hi>Solomon, That a man ſhould rejoice in his labour, this is his portion,</hi> That is, It is a begun Reward, a temporarie Recompence of his Labour and Pains.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though Man had never ſo large a meaſure of the Things of this Earth, he ſhould never eſteem himſelf to have got his Portion which God allows upon him, till he find himſelf enabled by ſpecial Grace, to go about his duty, in the ſtrength, and for the Glory of Chriſt, and ſo as he may have ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of true Joy in confidence of the acceptation of his Perſon and Works; and he that hath attained to this, were his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of things worldly never ſo ſmall, he ſhould count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have his Portion, which is better than all other things on Earth: For, <hi>That a man ſhould rejoice in his works, this</hi> (ſaith the wiſe Man) <hi>is his portion.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. While Men are ſtrangers to this chearful following of their duty, which is truely their portion here; they will be no leſs anxious, and earneſt in purſuing things earthly, and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up for the future, than if they were either never to part with them, or after Death to come back again, and enjoy them. For this Queſtion ſpeaks to Men whoſe practice is ſuch as if they were led by this Principle, that they ſhould return <hi>to ſee,</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>to enjoy</hi> what they once left

                  <p>THE firſt Motive ſerving to promove Mortification, and to wean the hearts of Men from any Happineſs imaginable in this Earth, and work them to ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under Affliction, is, That he obſerved it ordinary in the World, that proud Oppreſſours are proſperous, and the Godly are in a ſad condition under them: And this he ſaith he <hi>Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Conſidered:</hi> Whereby is meant, that he turned his thoughts again upon this ſubject; having in the former Chapter <hi>ver.</hi> 16. conſidered that oppreſſion that was in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seats, he here views all other ſorts of oppreſſion, that were under the Sun, ſo far as his knowledge and information, (which was very large) could reach; or rather that he had all the ſeveral kinds of oppreſſions, which are very many, and whereof no place under the Sun, where ſinful Men are, is free, repreſented to him by the Spirit of the Lord. Concerning
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51442:119"/>
which he calls all to conſider <hi>Three</hi> things that much affect his own heart; <hi>First,</hi> The mournful caſe of the oppreſſed, ſet out by the ſign thereof, their <hi>Tears. Secondly,</hi> The great power of their Oppreſſours, wanting nothing that might ſerve for execution of their cruel deſigns. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed had no Comforter, to wit, among Men; And becauſe this was the bittereſt Ingredient in this caſe, and called moſt for ſympathie; therefore he repeats it twice that <hi>They had no Comforter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. They that would work their own hearts to a mortified frame, muſt not be ſlight and ſuperficial in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon any ſubject, that may be bleſt for that end, but frequent and ſerious in pondering it, and careful to find out more Conſiderations that may increaſe the ſame: For, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> having been upon this Conſideration before, returns again to it, and dyves farther in it, <hi>I returned and conſidered all the oppreſſions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Oppreſſion is a very general Evil, in ſo much as no place under the Sun, is uſually free of it: So this Sin is a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with many Heads; and there are very many ways that Men become guilty of it; not onely by making their power a ſufficient Title to other Mens Eſtates, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.2, 3. By perverting of Juſtice and Law for Bribes; or Reſpect to Perſons; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. Or by detaining that which is due to Inferiours, as Wages from the Hireling <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. Which are the more open and groſs ways of Oppreſſion, ordinary among Men; But alſo by taking advantage of the ſtraits of others, to draw their Conſent to what is unjuſt, and prejudicial to them, as is ordinary under pretence of fair Merchandice. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.14. Blaſting the deſerved eſteem of others by Slanders. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55.3. Yea, and the with-holding of Charity from the Poor, when God calls for it <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. All which the Scriptures cited make clear to be in Gods Account, <hi>plain Oppreſſion,</hi> and undoubtedly have been Conſidered by <hi>Solomon,</hi> as common in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51442:120"/>
all places of the World, while he ſaith, <hi>I returned and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Lords People are not inſenſible of the Injuries they receive from their Oppreſſours, ſeing Grace doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, but rectify their natural Paſſions, and Affections: So they are often that low, that they have nothing left them whereby to eaſe their hearts, but to mourn before God, and to pour forth Prayers and Tears to Him, who puts their Tears in His Bottle: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a main Eye upon the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Godly, while he ſaith, <hi>And behold the Tears of the Oppreſsed,</hi> As if they had no more that they could do for their eaſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although the Lords People do never want that Bleſſed Comforter <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. Who is in a ſpecial way preſent with them, while they are Oppreſſed, and ſuffering for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Yet in their ſad condition they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten few or none among Men to be comfortable to them; even of theſe whoſe Relations, and Ingagements tye them moſt ſtrictly thereunto; Which flows from the want of the Fear of the Lord, that puts Man to theſe Duties which Mans Law preſſeth not, <hi>Job</hi> 6.14. Such as this is of ſympathie and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling, and the expreſſions thereof; and from the fear of Oppreſſours, leaſt reſpect to the Oppreſſed may bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their condition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.11, 12. And likewiſe from the Lords Gracious purpoſe to try His own compleatly, and make them ſeek after, and ſet a great value upon Divine Conſolations: For to the mourning <hi>Oppreſsed, there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> to wit, among Men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not only the duty of theſe that are Fellow-ſufferers, to ſympathize with, and be comfortable to one another; but alſo, and eſpecially of thoſe who are in Tranquillity, to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with theſe that are under Oppreſſion, and incite others to do the ſame: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> who was in much proſperity, the moſt part of his time, and while he was writting this Book
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51442:120"/>
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.25. ſpeaks here as a tender hearted Sympa hizer with the Oppreſſed, and calls upon others to look on them with pity, and to be comfortable to them, while he ſaith, <hi>Behold the tears of the oppreſſed, and they had no Comforter,</hi> and again, <hi>They had no Comforter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord is pleaſed not only to ſuffer cruel Oppreſſours, to have external force at their Command, and abundance of Furniture for accompliſhing their cruel Deſigns; but likewiſe to have ſtrength of Body, and vigour of natural Spirits, for that end, until His Work about His People be perfected by them, and the Cup of their Iniquity be full: For, all theſe are in the ſignification of this Word <hi>Power,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>Is on the ſide,</hi> or, in the hand, as that other Word is, of their Oppreſſours, <hi>And upon the part of their Oppreſſours was Power.</hi>

                  <p>THE Preacher here ſhews what effects the conſideration of thoſe grievous Oppreſſions mentioned in the former Words, had upon him: As 1. That he commended the ſtate of them who have by Death eſcaped the ſight of ſuch Diſhonour to God, and the feeling of ſuch Miſeries, as much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their ſtate who are pyning away under them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to manifold Temptations, of whom no better can be ſaid than that they live, and that is <hi>All.</hi> Yea, 2. He preferred the ſtate of him who is not yet born, both to the ſtate of them who have wreſtled thorow theſe Miſeries, and them that are yet in their paſſage, becauſe ſuch a one hath not ſeen, or as the force of the Word is, <hi>hath not felt the miſeries,</hi> nor been expoſed to the Temptations that are in this World. This ſeems to be the literal and ſafeſt ſenſe of the Words; and according to it, theſe Objections which may ariſe from the Expreſſions may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered: As 1. If it be enquired, How doth <hi>Solomon</hi>'s praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dead more than the Living agree with the Saints praiſing of the Living more than the Dead, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.18, 19, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6.5.? The Anſwer is, In theſe places the ſtate of the Dead as wanting opportunity of Praiſing and Glorifying God, is compared with the ſtate of the Living who have it. and ſo this is preferred to that. Here the ſtate of the Dead conſidered as ſetting man above the reach of temporal Miſeries and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is compared with the ſtate of the Living expoſing them to both, and ſo the preference may be contrary. And 2. If it be again urged, how can the ſtate of him that is not yet born, be preferred to the ſtate of thoſe that are Dead, ſeing the Godly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51442:121"/>
that are in Bleſſedneſs have eſcaped theſe Miſeries and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he that is to be born is to be exerciſed with? The Anſwer is the ſame in ſubſtance, that he compares the ſtate of not being at all, with the ſtate of being Miſerable, and expoſed to Temptations, abſtracting as it were from the future and eternal ſtate of Men, that thereby he may expreſs the holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and Grief he had at the ſight of Gods diſhonour, and His Peoples Miſery.</p>
                  <p>Doctr. 1. Although it cannot conſiſt with right Reaſon, much leſs with true Piety, to deſire Death or undervalue Life, becauſe of the Miſeries incident to it, ſeing a rational Life is one of the greateſt of meer outward Bleſſings, whereunto all the reſt are ſubſervient; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. and which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, by the worth, and good uſe which may be made of it, all the Miſeries incident to it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. yet in order to the eſcaping of theſe great Evils, the ſight of God's Diſhonour, and His Peoples Miſery, the hazard of being aſſaulted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with theſe Temptations which are worſe than Death, and in order to the obtaining of perfect freedom, not only from Miſery, but from Sin and Temptations, and of the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's preſence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.22. Natural Life may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undervalued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Death praiſed, and preferred to it; In which ſenſe we may ſafely conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> here to ſpeak thus, <hi>Wherefore I praiſed the Dead which are already Dead, more than the Living,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mans life for the moſt part in regard of the Miſeries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to it, and the ſad Spectacles that are in it, is but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Death, a languiſhing and pining away, a continual mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:51442:122"/>3. The Lord doth wiſely make uſe of ſad Diſpenſations to looſe mens hearts, from the too great eſteem they have of their natural Life, and being in this World; And to allay the abhorrency they have at Death, which ſhould make the Lords people ſubmiſſive to ſuch Diſpenſations, and labour to find this effect thereof upon themſelves, which <hi>Solomon</hi> here expreſſes to have been produced upon him by them, <hi>Wherefore I praiſed the Dead which are already Dead, more than the Living</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So tender are truly Gracious Hearts of Gods Honour, and ſo deſirous to ſee the reſt of His people well in the World, that (with ſubmiſſion to His good will) they could forfeit their natural Life, and all the comforts of it, rather than ſee Him diſhonoured, and His people in Miſery. For, ſuch a frame of ſpirit may this expreſs to us, produced in <hi>Solomon</hi> by the former ſad ſights, <hi>I praiſed the Dead</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yea better is he that is not yet Born</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>HEre is the ſecond Obſervation which <hi>Solomon</hi> holds forth to wean mens hearts from ſeeking Happineſs in this Earth. And it is upon the entertainment that mens induſtry and pains in well doing, doth ordinarly meet with in the World, and the effect which that Entertainment hath ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon men, <hi>Again</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I conſidered all travel, and every Right work,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51442:122"/>
which he took to conſideration, but one, and the ſame, to wit, that toilſome Labour, or painful Induſtrie (as the Word <hi>Travel</hi> ſignifies) which men take about that which is Right or Approven, as the Word ſignifies, to wit, in Gods ſight. And this appears by his ſpeaking of both as one, while he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth what Entertainment this ſort of work hath in the World, For <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a man is envied;</hi> The better a mans actions be, the more is he hated by them that cannot do the like, even by his moſt intimat familiar Friend; as the Word <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> ſignifies. And this he Cenſureth as Vanity, both a ſinful Vanity upon the part of the envious, who are grieved at what they ought to rejoice in, to wit, others well-doing, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a diſappointing unſatisfying Vanity upon the part of the envied, who often look for other Entertainment to their <hi>Right Works.</hi> And then he ſhews what is the ordinary effect which this bad Entertainment of good Actions hath upon men, it eats up with anxiety the Spirits, eſpecially of thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comfort themſelves in Gods approbation againſt mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: And ſeing all men in the World are ſubject to this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, either to envy others for doing well, or being envied by others for well-doing, to vex their own Spirits, it is mans wiſdom to ſeek his Happineſs elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. There is ſo much oppoſition from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſo much indiſpoſition within every man to what is right, and approven in Gods ſight, that a man may expect his duty, and every part of it ſhall coſt him ſome toil, and pains of Body, and mind, ſo that he will not get his heart engaged to it, nor holden on in it, except the love of Chriſt conſtrain him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. For, this Word, which expreſſes the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Right Work,</hi> ſignifies toilſome and painful labour, <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all Travel and every Right work.</hi>

                  <p>Hence learn. 1.

                  <p>Hence Learn 1. As the vain and ſinful Courſes which Men take for Happineſs in this Earth, are ſo many and various, that let a diligent Obſerver turn himſelf never ſo often, to what hand he will, he ſhall always ſee more and more of them; So thoſe who would promove the Work of Mortification in their own hearts, ought to ſearch them all out, and ſtudy the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one of them after another: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here, after he hath made many Obſervations upon the Vanity that Men are ſubject to, he ſaith, <hi>I returned again, and ſaw Vanity under the Sun.</hi>

All the vain and ſinful Courſes which Men take for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this Earth, though they lead all to one Black End, yet are they very farr different one from another, ſome of them being upon one extreme, ſome upon another; ſo that Men have no ground to pleaſe themſelves, if they be out of God's Way, though they be not walking in the Way that others are in, as they are ready to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. ſeing there are moe ways to Hell than one or two.

Yet the greater Mens charge of that ſort be, the more careful and diligent in lawful pains they ought to be, and more than thoſe who have fewer to provide: For while the Sin of the Covetous Man is aggravated by this, that he <hi>hath neither Child nor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and yet <hi>there is no end of all his labour,</hi> It is imported, that if he had had theſe Relations, he had been leſs guilty than now while he hath <hi>neither Child,</hi> &amp;c. and yet <hi>there is no end of all his labour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the Lord in His Providence ſo ordereth, that Men of great Subſtance, and Riches in the World, have few or none of near Relation to them, to whom they may leave the ſame, it ſhould much abate their earneſtneſs in the purſuit of theſe things, and make them beſtow more of their time and labour about things Spiritual and Heavenly, and think of imploying their Wealth for the Poor, and other Pious Uſes: For he makes it an Aggravation of Man's guilt, that having neither <hi>Child nor Brother, there ſhould be no end of his labour.</hi>

So large is the capacity, and appetite of a rational Soul, and ſo great emptineſs is there in the Creatures, that not only the greateſt things they can enjoy, cannot ſatisfy them, but all that their Eyes can ſee, cannot do it; how fooliſh are Men who ſpend not their labour for that which can ſatisfy, even the Graces, and Conſolations of Gods Spirit? <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36.8.

When Men have given up themſelves to the Slavery of any worldly Luſt, their thoughts are ſo taken up with it, that not only the matters of their Souls are neglected, but even theſe thoughts which are moſt obvious and common, are baniſhed. For there is nothing more ordinary among Men, than to conſider for whom they are taking pains; yet when a Man hath once given up himſelf to the ſervice of that Idol <hi>Mammon,</hi> he hath not ſo much leaſure, as to ſay to his own heart, <hi>For whom do I labour?</hi>

As the inordinat love, and earneſt purſuit of things worldly, deprives Men of the comfortable uſe of the Creatures, and of the true good of Communion with God; ſo the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this their loſs, is a powerful mean to abate the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their love to, and purſuit of theſe things; as is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51442:127"/>
like; yet conſidering <hi>Solomon</hi> as preaching to the Church, it cannot but be moſt ſafe, and uſeful, to apply the ſame to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Religious Society, and what he ſpeaks to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it will be the clearer, if we conceive him at the direction of the Spirit of the Lord, making uſe of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Fellow-labourers about one Employment, Fellow-ſouldiers in one Warfare, and Fellow-travellers in one Journey, as all Chriſtians are.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>First,</hi> He aſſerts that Society is to be preferred to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs, while he ſaith, <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is. That two or moe concurring about any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duty, are in a better caſe, they have more comfort and advantage, as the Word (<hi>Better</hi>) ſignifies, if they improve their Society aright, than either of them could have, being alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He giveth Reaſons hereof, by ſetting down particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, ſeveral of the Advantages to be had by Society rightly improven, and ſome of the Diſadvantages of the want of it.</p>
                  <p>He ſpeaks of the Advantages in the future, as things that will fall out, not as if they would alwayes be found even in the beſt Societies, but hereby expreſſing according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Language of Scripture, what is Man's Duty, and what one Chriſtian may expect as the benefit of anothers Society, and what will be found when Society is bleſt, and rightly made uſe of. The <hi>fiirst</hi> Advantage is, that, <hi>They have a good Reward for their Labour,</hi> whereby is meant, That though their mutual help, and encouraging one of another, their Work hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs, and ſo their Reward from Grace ſhall be greater, than if each of them had been wreſtling alone at their Duty, neglecting to take the help of another. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Advantage is, That <hi>if they fall the One will lift up his Fellow,</hi> the meaning is, If Either of them fall into Trouble, or by the power of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into any Sin, or Errour, by the Bleſſing of God upon the right uſe of Chriſtian Society, the fallen may recover, or if they both ſhould fall (as it is in the Original) their Falls may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51442:128"/>
be not alike hurtful, the one may ſoon recover himſelf, and help up his Companion. To which Advantage he ſubjoines the Diſadvantage of the want of Chriſtian Society, <hi>Wo to him that is alone,</hi> whereby is meant no more, but that he is in a dangerous and ſad condition, who, when he falls into Trouble or Sin, hath none to help, or endeavour his recovery, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if for baſe and ſinful Reſpects, he have voluntarly choſen to be alone. The <hi>third</hi> Advantage of Society, is held forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſimilitude of two Travellers, who lodge and ly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all night, for the Word tranſlated to <hi>Ly,</hi> is uſed of Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26 6. and of being Sick, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.8. and ſo ſeems not to be taken Properly, but Metaphorically, for Cohabitation, or mutual Society, eſpecially in an afflicted Condition. Then by their <hi>having of heat</hi> is meant, their mutual imparting of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Strength one to another, in their lawful undertakings, eſpecially under Afflictions, and with this he joins the ſecond Diſadvantage of the want of Society, <hi>How can One be warm alone?</hi> He means, it will prove a great difficulty for One to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or encouragement in his courſe, who hath none of the Lords People to aſſiſt him. The <hi>fourth</hi> Advantage is, That if any Chriſtian have the worſe in his Combat againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or wreſtling thorow Difficulties, he may expect Help, and Victory, by the Bleſſing of God upon his uſing of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others. And the <hi>fifth</hi> Advantage, which may be taken for an illuſtration of the former, ſet forth in a proverbial ſpeech is, That the joint ſtrength of Chriſtians ſhall not eaſily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt, and ſo Society may be bleſt, to prevent the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard implyed in the former Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. Although it be always much better to be <hi>Alone,</hi> than in wicked ſociety, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.1. and ſometimes better to be <hi>Alone,</hi> than in the ſociety of the beſt, as when we are called to ſecret Duties, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6.6. yet for the comfortable and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful performance of common and weighty Duties, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Difficulties, the Society of the Godly is a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51442:128"/>
The Lord who alone is Self-ſufficient, hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any one ſuch a meaſure of Light or ſtrength, as can put them beyond the neceſſity of making uſe of others; but would have every one to ſeek help from, and every one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give help to, others; Therefore is ſociety here commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Two are better than One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As no lawful Employment rightly gone about, ſhall want its own Reward, which may be lawfully eyed by the Lord's People for their encouragement; ſo the improving of Chriſtian Society for our furtherance in duty, hath a ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not only after time, but even in this Life. Hereby His People may expect to be ſharp'ned, and have an edge put upon them in their Duty, <hi>Prov</hi> 27.17. to have incouragements from others againſt Difficulties, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16. and freſh ſupplies of the Spirit drawn from Heaven to each other, by their mutual Prayers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. and ſo both their work is furthered, and their future Reward enſured: For this is the firſt Advantage of Chriſtian Society. <hi>They have a good Reward for their labour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As none of the Children of the Lord are beyond the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of falling either into Sin, or ſad Afflictions, while they are in their Journey to Heaven; ſo their Falls, of what ſort ſoever, muſt not make others of His People deſert them, but then eſpecially to prove their Affection to them, by ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſupport or reſtore them. And it is a great Mercy for a Man fallen into Sin or Miſery, to have One who will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>Lift him up again.</hi> For as the hazard of Falling is here imported to be common to all the Lord's People, ſo the duty of each of them to another is holden out alſo, <hi>For if they fall the One will lift up his fellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Although it be the Lord alone who is the Principal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of preſerving his own from falling, and reſtoring them after their falls <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.14. Yet he makes uſe of ſome of his people as inſtruments in his hand, to reſtore others fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide them, <hi>For, if they fall, the One will lift up his fellow.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 Athough the Children of the Lord are never left all alone; having his preſence even under their falls <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. And ſo cannot but be bleſt even when they want human help, yet ought they to look upon their being deſerted of others of his people, as a great diſadvantage. For to them eſpecially is this here ſpoken, that thereby they may be ſtirred up to make ſure his favourable preſence with them, and make uſe of the help of others when they may have it, <hi>Woe to him that is alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7.

The Children of the Lord ſhould ſo entertain his Spirit, and labour to have his Graces, Love, Fear and the like, in ſuch vigour in their hearts, even under the ſadeſt condition they can be in, that they may impart heat and warmth unto others: for it is here implyed that if they be together, they ſhould warm one another, <hi>if Two lye together, then they have heat.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a fourth conſideration offered to men, to wean their hearts from the apprehenſion of any Happineſs in this Earth, and it is concerning that Vanity which ordinarly attends Worldly Greatneſs, wherein the men of this World often place their greateſt Happineſs: And this he ſets forth by

comparing a <hi>Poor and Wiſe-Child,</hi> with an <hi>Old and fooliſh King.</hi> By the <hi>Poor and Wiſe Child</hi> is meant any one of a mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible outward condition, who yet is endued with <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> from above, and ſo is ſubject to the Counſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the Lord in his word; And by the <hi>Old and Fooliſh King</hi> is meant, any one advanced to Eminency and Worldly Greatneſs, who being deſtitute of ſaving Knowledge, and long ſpared in an evil courſe is now become incorrigible, and will not be Counſelled or admoniſhed by others. The former, (to wit, the <hi>Mean</hi> and contemptible One) <hi>Solomon</hi> preferrs to the latter, and commends him, as in a far more happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than the other for all his Greatneſs. And this he proves by the Lords Diſpenſations about the one and the other, which are ſometimes found to differ. As for <hi>the Poor and Wiſe Child,</hi> his wiſdom is bleſt to advance him from an abject and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able outward Condition (whereunto ſuch an one is often brought under wicked Rulers) even to Dignity and Greatneſs in the World; And for <hi>the Old, and Fooliſh King,</hi> who was born in his own Kingdom, and ſo born Heir of a Crown, by his Folly and Obſtinacy he is in Gods diſpleaſure brought to Miſery. Now theſe events are not to be underſtood, as if they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo fall out to perſons ſo qualified: ſeing it is clear that many of the Godly may remain in a deſpicable and afflicted condition, ſo long as they are in the World, and many wicked men in Eminency may carry their Riches and Greatneſs to their end with them. But the meaning is, that there are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and have been in all ages, frequent inſtances of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, as is clear in the example of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a <hi>Poor and Wiſe Child,</hi> brought out of Priſon to Reign, and of <hi>Pharaoh, Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim, Zedekiah,</hi> and others, <hi>Old and Fooliſh Kings,</hi> who would not be admoniſhed, brought down from their Dignity to great Miſery: And it may be <hi>Solomon</hi> hath here an Eye to the Lords different Diſpenſations with his own Father, and with <hi>Saul,</hi> to both of whom the Deſcriptions here, do in ſome ſort
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51442:130"/>

                  <p>THE laſt Obſervation holds forth another Vanity attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worldly Greatneſs, which floweth not from the fault of perſons in power, as the former, but from the inconſtancy of peoples Affections, who ſoon fall off from the preſent Ruler, and become fond upon the ſucceeding, of whom likewiſe they will as ſoon weary: The conſideration whereof may wean the hearts of Men from placing their Happineſs in worldly Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>And in expreſſing this Obſervation, the Preacher ſhews <hi>Firſt,</hi> What a large view he took of all the people in the World, he <hi>conſidered all the Living that walk under the Sun,</hi> to wit, as Subjects under ſome one Magiſtrat or other, not as if he could have had every individual perſon ſubjected to his thoughts, but that his vaſt and comprehenſive wit, enlarged and aſſiſted by the Spirit of the Lord, reached ſo far, as he might underſtand the ordinary temper of all Men, in reference to their Magiſtrats.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He joined with this, the conſideration of the <hi>Second Child,</hi> or did conſider jointly all the people and this <hi>Second Child:</hi> Now

whether we take this <hi>Second Child</hi> for the Son of the <hi>Poor and Wiſe Child</hi> formerly mentioned, who was <hi>brought out of Priſon to Reign,</hi> or for that Child himſelf, as coming to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, called <hi>Second</hi> in reference to his Predeceſſor the <hi>Old and Fooliſh King,</hi> it is all one as to the purpoſe in hand.

                  <p>And 3. He ſhews what he found remarkable and uſeful to his ſcope, in this conſideration. And 1. He found that <hi>There was no end of all the People:</hi> whereby is meant, That their Affectation of changes in Government, <hi>is Boundleſs,</hi> and their fondneſs upon the newly advanced, or advancing perſon, all of them following him, and Adoring the Riſing Sun, <hi>is Endleſs,</hi> even as the people that lived before them were wont to do to him whom they within a little forſook: So that though the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of their Fathers be gone; yet this perverſe humour of doating upon Men at their firſt advancement to Power, is not at an end, but lives yet in them that come after. 2.

And laſtly, He paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Cenſure upon this diſpoſition of people, and the lot of Magiſtrats, that it is Vanity, or a proof of the emptineſs of Humane Courſes to give Men true ſatisfaction, and proves to them who ſeek it in them, a <hi>Vexation,</hi> or eating up <hi>of their Spirit.</hi>

When people follow theſe who have before them, in their fooliſh and ſinful Courſes, the Lord ordinarly blaſts their Expectations, and gives them no matter of <hi>Rejoicing</hi> where they promiſed moſt of it to themſelves: For, when they are fond upon the riſing Ruler, as their Anceſtors were in the like caſe, the Lord paſſeth the ſentence upon them, <hi>They ſhall not</hi> (long) <hi>Rejoice in him.</hi>
                  </p>

Thoſe who are moſt <hi>Overjoyed</hi> with new Rulers, when firſt they are advanced to their Dignities, are readieſt to be the greateſt Leathers of them: Peoples affections can ſcarcely abide any conſiderable time in the height or extremity: For, here it is ſet out as the general temper of people, that they are very much taken with men riſing to Honour, and Power over them the one day, and the next day they loath them, For (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>I conſidered all the Living under the Sun—that walk with the Second Child—that they ſhall not rejoice in him.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. Peoples affection, and reſpect to their Rulers is ordinarly very changeable, being founded not upon their Office, as an

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Every man advanced to Eminency, Power, or Eſteem among men, ſhould look upon himſelf as ſtanding upon a very ſlippery Foundation, and particularly upon Worldly applauſe, as a flower that will ſoon wither, and become unſavoury; And though they live not long, they ſhould reſolve to ſee their own applauſe, and Peoples delight in them, die before themſelves; For, hereof are ſuch men certified, as that which in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effect of Peoples inconſtant humour, <hi>They that come after ſhall not rejoice in him.</hi>

Preacher ſets down two branches of the dehortation, The one is that men would bewarr to utter ſuch unadviſed reſolutions and Vows with their mouth, as being once ſpoken and determined with them, do (through their pride and corruption) make them conceive themſelves under a kind of neceſſity to ſtand to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, and to cauſe their flesh or members of their Body to be active in accomplishing what they have rashly and ſinfully Vowed, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> The other Branch is, That people would not excuſe or mince the making and keeping of ſuch unadviſed and ſinful Vows, when they are diſcovered to them to be ſuch, by giving them ſuch an extenuating name, as only to call them, <hi>An Errour,</hi> or <hi>Small miſtake;</hi> But that they look on them as a grievous offence deſerving a worſe deſignation, <hi>ver. 6. (2)</hi> He preſſeth this direction by ſeveral Motives, As <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe rash Vows involve the whole man in ſin, <hi>ver. 6. Next,</hi> That this ſinful courſe is highly aggravated not ſo much by being in the preſence of publick Miniſters of the Church, who are called <hi>Angels</hi> in Scripture, And in the view of holy Angels who frequently are witneſſes to our Religious Actions, As that it is done before the face of the great Angel of the Covenant <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ver. 6. Thirdly,</hi> The fiery indignation of God againſt ſuch inadvertant mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and peremptory ſtanding to the performance of ſinful engagements, <hi>ver. 6. Fourthly,</hi> The Lords frequent overturning what devices and works men by theſe ſinful undertakings do build, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That there are many ſins and ſorrows attending and following that way of coming under rash and unlawful Vows which is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude or proverb: <hi>That as in the multitude of Dreams there are many wild fancies, which evanishing leave a man, when he awakes under fretting and vexation, ſo in multiplying of words; eſpecially in rash Vows, there are many ſinful vanities and vexing diſappointments.</hi> ver. <hi>7.</hi> And <hi>(3)</hi> he lays down an effectual remedy againſt the foreſaid evil (which may alſo have the place of another direction) of rash and ſinfull undertakings; which is that People would ſtudy to keep themſelves under a holy and reverential fear of God, both in his Goodneſs and Judgements. The want of which is the root (as of other ills ſo) of this precipitant way of Vowing and engaging ſinfull courſes, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> The <hi>Fifth Direction</hi> is, Concerning ſubmiſſion unto the wiſe providence of God in ordering the ſadeſt diſpenſations for the good of his Saints, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> In proſecution of which.

the profit or encreaſe of the earth, is for the Poor as well as the Rich; and therefore the great ones ſhould not by violence take all from them, as if it only belonged to themſelves. <hi>ver. 9.</hi> The other is, That the mighty Monarchs of the World are themſelves furniſhed by the fruits of the ground, through the induſtry of the poor Labourers, which ſhould hinder them from oppreſſing them, <hi>ver. 9.</hi>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having diſcovered the Vanity of the principal Courſes which Men take for Happineſs in the Earth, and held forth ſeveral Conſiderations, to divert Mens hearts from them: He cometh now in the firſt part of this Chapter to give directions for attaining to that true Peace and Quietneſs which is attainable in this Life. The firſt Direction is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the right way of going about the Worſhip of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in publick, where moſt ordinarly Communion with the Lord is to be had: and this he holds forth in two Branches. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That Men ſhould <hi>Watch over</hi> (as the Word tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

The <hi>Second</hi> is concerning the hearty receiving of the Mind of God, delivered in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies of His People, that Men ſhould be <hi>ready to Hear</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>Draw near to Hear,</hi> not only the Voice of Miniſters, but of the Lord Himſelf ſpeaking to them, with dependance upon Him for His Bleſſing upon the Truth. And this he preſſeth as that which ſhould take up people more than the external performance of Duties, which being ſeparat from internal Worſhip, conſiſting in the Right ordering of the Affections, and hearty receiving of the Word, is nothing elſe <hi>but the Sacrifice of Fools.</hi> The external part of Worſhip is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> becauſe that was in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time a principal part of publick Worſhip, comprehending all the reſt. Now to reſt upon that without looking to <hi>Christ the true Sacrifice</hi> and to the Internal and Spiritual Worſhip, was but <hi>Folly</hi> in Gods account; and this he diſſwades from, by a reaſon taken from the diſpoſition of formal Hypocrites, who if they perform the External Duties, never lay to heart how much Sin is in their ſervice, that ſo they might be chafed to <hi>Christ the true Sacrifice</hi>

                  <p>And this Direction hath Three Branches: The <hi>First</hi> relates to <hi>Vocal</hi> Prayer, that we do not take upon us <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nadviſedly,</hi> and without ſerious pondering of what we are to ſay, to expreſs any thing to God in that Duty. The <hi>Second</hi> relates to <hi>Mental</hi> Prayer, that we do not preſent to the Lord our ſudden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Wiſhes or Deſires, which have as plain a language to Him as our Words, but that we ſhould labour to compoſe our Spirits, and form ſuch Deſires in our hearts to be offered to the Lord, as we may be ſure will be well-pleaſing to Him;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51442:139"/>
and this is the way to prevent the <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> in our words before mentioned. And both theſe he preſſeth by two Reaſons, the one taken from the conſideration of God's Soveraignity and Excellency, whereof the Glorious <hi>Heavens (where He is ſaid to be,</hi> becauſe He doth there moſt gloriouſly manifeſt Himſelf) ſerve to put us in mind. The other from the conſideration of our own Baſeneſs and Vileneſs, whereof our dwelling place <hi>the Earth,</hi> ſerves to keep us mindful. The <hi>Third</hi> Branch of the Direction, which is alſo enforced by theſe two Reaſons, is poſitive, that we ſtudy to expreſs our Wants and Deſires to God in Prayer, in as few Words as can be, which is not againſt fervent inſiſting in that Duty, but mainly againſt Formality, and vain Repetitions therein.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1.

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> giveth here ſome farther Reaſons to diſſwade from <hi>Raſh</hi> and Inconſiderat ſpeaking to God in Prayer, and from idle multiplying of Words in that Duty, and theſe he expreſſes in two proverbial Speeches or Similitudes, taken from things common among Men, the Application whereof to the purpoſe may be eaſily gathered from what goes immediately before. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That <hi>Dreams come from the multitude of buſineſs:</hi> The meaning whereof according to the Scope is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That as mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of diſtracting Buſineſſes in the Day, occaſions many confuſed Fancies in the Night; So Men being exceſſively taken up with the things of this Earth, and having their Hearts (which ſhould be kept in a praying frame what ever they do) drowned in Wordly Employments, they muſt needs, if they ſpeak any thing to God, ſpeak it very Inconcernedly and Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeing they take no leaſure to prepare their hearts for ſuch a Duty: So that this firſt ſimilitude or proverb, preſſeth the former diſſwaſive from raſh and inconſiderat ſpeaking to God, by diſcovering the cauſe of it, namely, mens Diſtraction with the multiplicity of Worldly affairs, and ſo conſequently points at the remedy thereof. The <hi>Second</hi> is, that <hi>a Fools Voice is known by the multitude of Words.</hi> The meaning whereof is, That as men diſcover their want of prudence even in common things by their much ſpeaking, ſo vain Babling, and a multitude of words unadviſedly uttered to God in Prayer, doth bewray a man to be deſtitut of the clear knowledge of Gods excellency, and of his own Baſeneſs, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake before: And this ſecond proverbial ſpeech doth alſo hold forth the effect of that <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> to wit, that it doth but diſcover men to be <hi>Fools.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. So much ſhould the Lords ſervants and people be taken up with things ſpiritual, eſpecially with the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51442:141"/>
intertaning of correſpondence and fellowſhip with God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the moſt ordinary and common occurrences ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with ſome profitable conſiderations, which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the right manner of going about that Duty, and may be held forth to others for their inſtruction therein: For here the wiſe man preſſeth upon himſelf and others the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by ſuch Obſervations of common occurrences, as few are unacquainted with, <hi>a Dream cometh through the multitude of Buſineſs, and a Fools Voice is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the multitude of worldly affaires wherewith men do exceſſively, and often without neceſſity take up their time, and the diſtraction of their hearts with theſe, that makes much raſhneſs and inadvertance in ſpeaking to God, while men take upon them in one day the Buſineſs and Toil of many days, they have no leaſure to commune with their own hearts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own caſe and Gods dealing with them, and this makes them that if they ſpeak to God at all, they cannot but ſpeak raſhly, for ſo much is held forth in the application of this ſimilitude, or Proverb, which is to be made according to the ſcope thus, <hi>As Dreams come from the multitude of Buſineſs,</hi> So raſh and inconſiderate Expreſſions in Prayer, often come from the toil and ſpending of Mens Spirits about things World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the word <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> in the Original, ſignifies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although the Lord in His Providence put many Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſome of His People at once, giving them the charge and over-ſight, not only of their own Eſtates, but of the Perſons and Eſtates of others, in which caſe they may go about their Affairs relating thereto with a good Conſcience, providing the ſame be done as Duty to God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.4. with acknowledgement of Him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. and the heart always as it may and ought to be in the greateſt variety of Imployment, kept in a diſpoſition for duty, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.23. Yet when Men ſuffer their Thoughts to be diſtracted with theſe things, ſo as they do not at all watch to Prayer, nor prepare for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51442:141"/>
that Duty, they provoke the Lord to take the uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Memory from them, when they go about it, that though they could ſpeak as an Oracle in other things, they ſhall ſpeak as Men in <hi>a Dream</hi> when they go to Prayer: And though ſome things ſpoken Raſhly by them in Prayer, may fall out to be pertinent; yet is the whole no more regarded by the Lord, than Mens <hi>Dreams</hi> uſe to be, though ſometimes the Event may fall out according to the <hi>Dream:</hi> For that Truth which this proverbial Speech or Similitude leads to, according to the Scope, amounts to this, That Mens <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> in their Prayers, which are in effect but their <hi>Dreams,</hi> flows from the <hi>Multitude</hi> of their worldly Affairs, and the diſtraction of their Minds with them, <hi>A Dream cometh through the multitude of buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They that would have their Sleep ſanctified, and ſo would be preſerved from <hi>ſinful</hi> or <hi>affrighting Dreams,</hi> ſhould watch over themſelves in the day time, and take good heed what <hi>Buſineſs</hi> they intangle themſelves with: For readily their Dreams in the Night, will have ſomething of the prevalent temper of their Spirits along the Day ſtamped upon them, as is imported in the truth that the Similitude holds forth in it ſelf. <hi>Dreams come through the multitude of buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Even when the Lord did extraordinarly manifeſt Himſelf to His Servants through <hi>Dreams,</hi> and Viſions, theſe were not otherways looked upon in ordinary Men, than as the reſult of <hi>multitude of buſineſs,</hi> or ſome ſuch natural Cauſe, much leſs when the Lord takes not that way: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> to whom the Lord appeared extraordinarly by <hi>Dreams,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.5. holds forth this to others, that they ſhould look no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon their <hi>Dreams,</hi> than <hi>As coming from the multitude of buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As much Diſcourſe even in common things, argues much folly, ſo eſpecially in the Matters of God, and particularly in Prayer to Him, wherein though Men think they kyth much Wit, even ſo much as to prevail with God, by <hi>their much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:51442:142"/>
Mat 6.7. yet <hi>multitude of words</hi> in that Duty, doth often betray Mens great Ignorance and Darkneſs concerning moſt neceſſary Truths, eſpecially the Excellency and Greatneſs of God, and their own Baſeneſs and Unworthineſs: For this proverbial Speech hath a Truth in the literal meaning of it, and alſo in reference to the Scope, both which belong to the Doctrine. <hi>A Fools voice is known by the multitude of words.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is the Third Direction for attaining to that true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Peace and Contentment of Spirit, wherein much of Mans Happineſs attainable in this Life doth conſiſt, and it is concerning the conſcionable and ſpeedy performance of <hi>Vows</hi> made to God; becauſe at publick Ordinances, and ſecret Prayer, Men are often ingaged to that Duty: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> after he hath taught the right way of going about the Former, now preſſes the performance of the Latter, <hi>When thou vowest a Vow</hi> &amp;c. he doth not ſpeak of any Raſh or Unlawful Vow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men ingage themſelves, it may be to things in themſelves Lawful, but either raſhly, or without conſideration of what may fall out; ſuch as was <hi>Jephtha's</hi> Vow, or for ſome wicked end, as was <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s pretended Vow in <hi>Hebron,</hi> much leſs of Vows concerning things ſimply ſinful, as that of the Men who vowed to kill <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 23.14. ſeing ſuch Vows being made ought not to be payed at all. Neither doth he ſpeak of theſe general Vows and Engagements, whereby all within the Church (that are capable) ought expreſly to devot and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat themſelves wholly to the Lord, &amp; His obedience, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce the Service of Satan, the World, and their own Luſts: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe are abſolutely neceſſary by vertue of Divine Precepts,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51442:142"/>
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 76.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.21. and to refuſe the taking of ſuch Vows is one of the higheſt Sins whereof a Man can be guilty. And the laſt Reaſon whereby he preſſeth the performance of the Vows here ſpoken of agrees not to Vows of that ſort. Therefore he muſt be underſtood to ſpeak of Vows engaging to things lawful, but for the particular time and other circumſtances of them, Arbitrary, and in our own power: As for Example, when the Lord's People under ſome great trouble oblige themſelves to Thankfulneſs for a delivery, and to expreſs the ſame, in ſuch a manner, and at ſuch a time, as is not particularly determined in the Word of the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.13, 14. Or when they engage to abſtain from lawful Delights, in ſuch a meaſure, and at ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions, for promoving of Mortification, or better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Duties, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 132.2. to conſecrat ſo much of their time or ſubſtance to ſome pious Uſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. Or when they engage themſelves to the practice or forbearance of things indifferent in their own nature, as neceſſary for attaining ſome good end, as <hi>Paul</hi> took on the Vow of a <hi>Nazarite</hi> for the more effectual gaining of the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 21.23. though the thing was left for that time indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Now the conſcionable and ſpeedy performance of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements the Wiſe Man preſſeth here by two Reaſons, The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That God hath no pleaſure in, yea (as the expreſſion imports) he doth extremely deteſt and abhor ſuch Fools as ſlight their engagements, thinking to pleaſe him with empty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereupon he preſſes the duty again, <hi>Pay,</hi> or (as the word ſignifies) Perfect and Accompliſh <hi>that which thou hast Vowed,</hi> ver. 4. The <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon is, that it were better not to come under ingagements in ſuch caſes, than to ſlight the ſame being taken on; by which Reaſon it appears, he ſpeaks of Vows about ſuch things as are in a mans own power, at leaſt ſuch as for the circumſtances of them might without ſin have been otherwiſe reſolved upon, but being now determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51442:143"/>
and ingaged unto, ought to be conſcionably and ſpeedily performed, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 23 21.22.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. It is lawful for the Children of the Lord to tye themſelves by their expreſs promiſe to him, for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Duties at ſuch times, or with ſuch other circumſtances, as are not particularly determined in the word, and which without ſin might have been otherwiſe condeſcended upon; providing always they neither tye themſelves, to any thing in confidence of their own ſtrength, nor to any thing that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, or may be prejudicial to any other neceſſary duty, which may be for the circumſtances of it more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; but only to ſuch things as Chriſtian prudence, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the general Rules of the word, and waiting for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Spirit to lead them in all Truth, may direct them unto, that ſo they may be the more incited to Duty; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare their hearty Approbation of, and Deſire to be at their Duty <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.62-106. For of ſuch ingagements <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks, and ſuppoſes them to be lawful, elſe he would not preſs the performance of them, nor affirm their caſe to be better that make them not, than theirs who having made them, perform them not, <hi>When thou vowest a Vow unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not to pay it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. All lawful Vows, eſpecially Religious, are only to be made to the Lord, not to Angels, or Saints departed, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither precept nor example in Scripture for Vows of that nature, whereof there are many among the Papiſts: For ſo much is clearly intimat here, <hi>When thou vowest a Vow unto</hi> God, <hi>defer not to pay it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The firſt opportunity of performing lawful Vows ought to be imbraced, conſidering that the edge and zeal which the heart uſually hath in making them, will ſoon wear away, and Satan will not fail to coin and ſuggeſt difficulties, yea impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of performing them, and we our ſelves may ſhortly be out of capacity for the ſame, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man here) <hi>When thou vowest a Vow, defer not to pay it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:51442:143"/>4. The Lord is ſo far from taking <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in fair promiſes, which are not backed with real endeavours after performance, that he doth extremely abhorr the perſons that offer ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make no conſcience of performance, as is imported in this Expreſſion, <hi>He hath no pleaſure in Fools.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When men poſtpone the paying of their Vows, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Duties whereunto they have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they do prove themſelves <hi>Fools</hi> in Gods ſight, however Satan, and their own Hearts ſuggeſt to them that they are Wiſe in waiting for a fitter opportunity, or a better diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſo they are here called, <hi>He hath no Pleaſure in Fools,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> of God, ſhould be the great motive to put men to Duty, or make them afraid to neglect it, therefore is this made the firſt Reaſon of the Duty here preſſed, <hi>He hath no Pleaſure in Fools.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our Vows are imperfect things till they be performed, and ſo we ſhould have little ſatisfaction, though we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conſent and engagement of our hearts to Duty, till we be at performance of it: For the word, <hi>Pay,</hi> ſignifies to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or Accompliſh, <hi>Pay that which thou hast Vowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Though we cannot without ſin withold our hearts from engaging to Duties in the ſeaſon of them (though this be not particularly determined in the Word, ſeing it may be known by the general Rules thereof, and by imploying the promiſed Spirit to teach us how to apply them) nor can we without ſin forbear any thing, though never ſo indifferent in its own nature, when our Neighbours Edification requires us to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, whether we have taken on expreſs and formal Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon our ſelves to that purpoſe, or not; yet it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Guilt in Gods Sight to forbear ſuch a thing in the ſeaſon of it, after we have come under the Vows of God to perform it, than it would have been before, ſeing now we falſifie our expreſs promiſe and avowed purpoſe to God: For this is the ſecond Reaſon, <hi>Better it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldest vow and not pay.</hi>

                  <p>THe Preacher having given direction concerning the ſpeedy performing of lawful Vows, and that in order to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and entertaining of true Peace and Contentment, which is his Scope, he giveth here a Fourth Direction for the ſame end, concerning raſh Vows or ſinful Engagements.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> He holds forth this Direction or Diſſwaſive in Two Branches: The One is, that Men ſhould reſtrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from uttering ſuch raſh and unadviſed Purpoſes, as being once determined, do in a manner force them to the Execution of them, they apprehending themſelves under a ſort of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to act what they have raſhly vowed: For to <hi>ſuffer the Mouth to cauſe the Fleſh to ſin,</hi> is when Men are ſo diſtempered with the exceſs of Grief, Anger, or the like humane Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that they are not able to reſtrain themſelves, but do <hi>give away</hi> (as the Word is here) <hi>their Mouths</hi> to vent their raſh Purpoſes; and this being done, they apprehend themſelves under a neceſſity to ſtand to their Engagements, though never ſo ſinful, and ſo <hi>cauſe their Fleſh,</hi> or their whole Man (for which the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is oft put in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6:12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.) to be active in performing their raſh and ſinful Undertakings, as is clear in the Example of <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6.26. The other Branch of this Direction, is a diſſwaſive from extenuating ſuch Raſh and Sinful Vows, when they are diſcovered to be ſuch, <hi>Neither ſay thou it was an Errour,</hi> a Miſtake, or ſome light Fault, which is not to be underſtood as if ſuch raſh Vows were not <hi>Errours,</hi> and ſo not to be acknowledged as ſuch, but becauſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51442:144"/>
they proceed often rather from Mens Inconſideration, and want of the Fear of God, as is imported in the Remedy of them, held forth afterward, than from their ſimple Ignorance and Miſtake; therefore he would have Men not caſting them ſo lightly by their hand, but rather looking upon them as a more heinous Sin, and ſo deſerving a worſe Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He bears in this Direction by ſeveral Reaſons: The <hi>Firſt</hi> is imported in the Firſt Branch, that ſuch raſh undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings involve the whole Perſon in guiltineſs, as it were by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating him to act theſe Purpoſes. The <hi>Second</hi> is expreſt in the Second Branch, and is mainly againſt the Extenuation of them, in thoſe Words, <hi>Before the Angel;</hi> which Reaſon though it have force, taking the Angel either for any publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, who hath that Name both in the New and Old Teſtament, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. And ſo it may be taken here for the Prieſt, before whom, according to the Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, Sins of Ignorance (as it is here ſuppoſed Men will pretend their raſh Vows to be) were to be Confeſſed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. Or taking it for any of the Created Angels of Heaven, whom the Scripture frequently ſets forth as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our Actions, eſpecially in Religious Matters 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. Yet conſidering that the Reaſon being underſtood of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, doth neceſſarly include and imply the preſence of him who is the <hi>Great Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <hi>Angel</hi> here hath ſuch an Article, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth to prefix to Chriſts name, and likewiſe, becauſe if we take it thus, The Argument is ſtrongeſt, Therefore it ſeems ſafeſt to reſt in this that the Argument is drawn from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, who is a Witneſs and Avenger of Raſh Vows, and Mens Extenuations thereof. The <hi>Third</hi> Reaſon is taken from the juſt diſpleaſure of God with ſuch raſh Engagements, and the ſlighting of them, <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould God be Angry?</hi> the word ſignifies <hi>Foaming Anger,</hi> not as if there were any <hi>Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Fury</hi> in God, as uſes to be in man, but his juſt diſpleaſure
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51442:145"/>
is ſo expreſt, becauſe we cannot fear it as we ought, except we take it up under the ſimilitude of a mans <hi>Rage;</hi> which makes him <hi>Foam</hi> with Anger, and deſire to be avenged upon his Enemy. And he puts this Reaſon in a Queſtion, thereby preſſing the Raſh and Inconſiderat man, to conſider his hazard; Neither is the Queſtion to be ſo underſtood, as if the Lord had no Reaſon to be <hi>Angry,</hi> but by it he would have Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Folly in adventuring ſo raſhly upon His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and making ſo light of that which ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Him. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Reaſon is taken from the effect of God's diſpleaſure, and that is the <hi>Destruction of the work of mens hands,</hi> the meaning whereof is, that hereby men provoke God to blaſt, and turn to nothing, their moſt ſerious undertakings, and <hi>Works</hi> wherein they take moſt pleaſure, even by their raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Vowing, and ſlighting of their guilt in ſo doing. The <hi>Fifth</hi> Reaſon is, that there are many ſins, and conſequently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrows and diſappointments attending this one ſin of raſh Vowing, both which are ſignified by this word, <hi>Diverſe Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and this is illuſtrate by a ſimilitude which hath this force, as in the multitude of mens Dreams, there are <hi>many vain and vexing Fancies,</hi> So, in many words, eſpecially in multiplying raſh Vows, there are many ſinful Vanities, and grievous Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following thereupon: For frequently in Scripture when two Sentences are thus coupled together, a Compariſon or ſimilitude between them is imported, ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He preſcribes the true remedy of this raſhneſs, which is that men ſtudy to keep their hearts under a holy fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God, the want whereof is the cauſe of the forementioned Miſcarriage: And this may ſafely be looked upon as a <hi>Fifth</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for attaining to true Peace and Contentment of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. So great is the force of unmortified Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Men who have not the powerful Reſtraint of God's Grace, and the uſe of ſanctified Reaſon to bridle their Paſſions, that the very Members of their Body have a great Propenſion
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51442:145"/>
to ſerve the corrupt inclinations of their Soul: And when one Member is given up to act any Wickedneſs, it hath as it were a conſtraining power, to carry all the reſt along with it, to concur with and be ſubſervient to it in committing more Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.4, 5. &amp;c. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>the Mouth</hi> as ſtrongly inclining to ſpeak <hi>Raſhly,</hi> and of the ſame having done ſo, as having a commanding power over the reſt of the Members, which muſt flow from the Corruption of Nature, while he ſaith, <hi>Suffer not thy Mouth to cauſe thy Fleſh to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men are ſo proud of their own Wit, naturally, and ſo unwilling to be eſteemed Raſh and Inconſiderat, that when they have proven themſelves to be ſo in their Words, they will rather prove themſelves to be ſo alſo by their Deeds, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting what they have raſhly reſolved, than by their forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof ſeem to take with their own Raſhneſs: For it is here ſuppoſed, that if once a Raſh Vow eſcape the Mouth, it will readily carry <hi>the whole Man</hi> to the execution of it, and that very forcibly, while it is ſaid, <hi>Suffer not thy Mouth to cauſe thy Fleſh to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that would entertain true Peace and Tranquility of Mind, muſt be very careful to <hi>Bridle their Tongues, and ſet a watch before the door of their Lips;</hi> and for that end, to watch over their Spirits, that their Affections and Paſſions ſwell not over the Banks, which often occaſions their raſh Purpoſes, there being nothing that more ordinarly marrs the peace of thoſe, who are otherwiſe tender Walkers, than Raſhneſs in diſcourſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. For this is a farther Direction for entertaining true Peace and Contentment of Spirit, <hi>Suffer not thy Mouth to cauſe thy Fleſh to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The difficulty of Mens reſtraining themſelves from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their raſh Purpoſes, ſhould make them very ſerious, and deliberat in taking on Vows, that if they cannot get them kept from ſtirring within, they may ſhut their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and hold them within Doors, for being once out, they will readily <hi>Cauſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:51442:146"/>
or imperiouſly Command <hi>the Fleſh to execute</hi> them, as this expreſſion emphatically runs in the Original, and may be looked upon as having a Reaſon in the boſome of it for diſſwading Men from venting their raſh Purpoſes, taken from the force and power which theſe have upon their Wills in order to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, <hi>Suffer not thy Mouth to cauſe thy Fleſh to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Men cannot altogether deny their Guiltineſs, they are very prone to extenuate the ſame, and to give their Sins very favourable Names, that they may not diſturb their own falſe Peace, nor put themſelves in fear of that Wrath which will certainly follow, and might be fled from, if they would look upon their Sins in the own Colours, and cloathed with the own Aggravations thereof: For that it is ordinary with Men ſo to do, is imported in this ſecond Branch of the Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, <hi>Neither ſay thou it was an Errour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Mediator and <hi>Great Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Who hath a more Excellent Name than any created Angel. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4. is a preſent Witneſs not only of Mens Actions, but of their Words, even ſuch as are moſt raſh, and which they themſelves think ſcarcely worthy to be taken notice of, and not only of their raſh Words, but of their Extenuations of the ſame; the conſideration whereof ſhould be a powerful Motive to make Men watchful over their Words: For this is a Reaſon of the Diſſwaſive from raſh Vowing, eſpecially from extenuating of it, that it is done before him. <hi>Neither ſay thou before the Angel that it was an Errour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is no leſs a Provocation of God to <hi>extenuat</hi> Sin, than to commit it: Yea, it is a greater, it being a new Sin added to the former, for covering of it, yea a defending of it in a great part: For this third Reaſon is eſpecially to be referred to the ſecond Branch of the Diſſwaſive from the extenuating of Sin. <hi>Why ſhould God be angry at thy Voice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Though there be no Paſſion in God as uſes to be in men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. yet they that ſpeak, or act contrary to His Will, may find
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51442:146"/>
ſuch dreadful Effects following upon His juſt Diſpleaſure, as Men uſe to apprehend upon the incenſed Fury of thoſe who are inraged againſt them, and ſo ought they to ſet forth His Wrath to their own Hearts for deterring them from Sin: Therefore is His Diſpleaſure here ſet forth by a word ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Foaming Anger,</hi> which is only incident to Men when they are beyond meaſure commoved with Paſſion: <hi>Why ſhould God be Angry,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. If Men would exerciſe their Reaſon, they might ſee their own <hi>Folly</hi> in adventuring upon God's Diſpleaſure ſo raſhly as they do, and in extenuating of their Guilt when they have done ſo: For this Queſtion is put to Mens Conſciences, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that they cannot give a Reaſon for their Practice, and that Conſcience being put to it, they could not but ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unreaſonable. <hi>Why ſhould God be Angry at thy Voice?</hi>

                  <p n="11">11.

                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Even theſe Sins which Men account leaſt of may draw down theſe Strokes which they account the ſoreſt of any other, and that eſpecially becauſe they extenuate theſe Sins: For
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51442:147"/>
there is nothing that Men value more, than the Works of their own hands, and nothing is more grievous than the deſtruction of theſe: And therefore the deſtruction of them is here threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Conſequent of God's Diſpleaſure, incenſed by Mens raſh Vows. and their extenuating of them, <hi>Why ſhould God be Angry at thy Voice, and deſtroy the work of thy hands?</hi>

                  <p>THis Verſe contains Two Arguments to diſſwade from <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> againſt which the Preacher hath guarded theſe hearts of the Oppreſſed in the former. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That the <hi>Profit,</hi> or <hi>Increaſe</hi> (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>of the Earth,</hi> which it yields to Man over and above his own Subſiſtence for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>is for All;</hi> the meaning is, it is the Lord's <hi>Allowance to All,</hi> to the Poor as well as the Rich: And therefore great Ones ſhould not by Oppreſſion ſuck all the Profit of the Earth from the Poor, as if it belonged to them only. The <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon is, That the greateſt on Earth are furniſhed by <hi>the Field,</hi> or by the <hi>Fruits of the Earth,</hi> yielding Neceſſaries to them, and to their Beaſts, which ſerve them for Food and Cloathing: And this Furniture coming to their hands, through the Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the <hi>Poor,</hi> they ought not to be Oppreſſed by the Great.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. The Lord hath ſo far mitigate the Curſe inflicted upon the <hi>Earth</hi> for Man's firſt Sin, in eating the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit thereof, that it will yield Increaſe and <hi>Profit</hi> to the Labourer for his pains, wherein his Mercy is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: For, ſaith <hi>Solomon, There is profit of the Earth,</hi> to wit, to the Labourer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Earth is alike obedient and liberal to <hi>All</hi> that culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat it, whatever their Qualifications be, the Lord will not have the Godly and the Wicked differenced, by the different ſucceſs of their Labours in the Earth, that is common to both: For <hi>the profit of the Earth is for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:51442:150"/>3. When Great Men that are exeemed from Labouring of the Ground, ſee that the Earth doth anſwer the poor Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as readily as it would do the King, if he ſhould put his hand to the Plough or Spade, it ſhould bring them to conſider that the <hi>Profit</hi> of the poor Man's Labour is the Lord's <hi>Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to him, and ſo ſhould deterr them from robbing him of it by <hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> For this may be taken as an Argument to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade from Oppreſſion, <hi>The profit of the Earth is for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When poor Labourers of the Ground have nothing for their pains, but what is abſolutely neceſſary for their Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by reaſon of the rigid Exactions of their Superiours, they have not then what the Lord allows upon them, which is the <hi>Profit,</hi> or, as the Word ſignifies, the <hi>Increaſe,</hi> the Abundance or Overplus, to wit, ſomething to provide for their Poſterity, and to imploy for pious Uſes. When they have ſcarce Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence though the Earth yields Abundance, their Superiours cannot clear themſelves of Oppreſſion: For this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſſwade from Oppreſſion, that the <hi>Increaſe,</hi> or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus (as the Word is) <hi>of the Earth is for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Proud Oppreſſours look upon the Profit and Increaſe of the Poors Labour, as if it were only appointed for them, and the Poor were only their Slaves and Servants, to lay all up for their uſe, and often would allow nothing to them, but that they ſee they cannot have their Service, nor acquire any thing to themſelves, except the Poor did ſome way ſubſiſt: For this may be looked upon as contradicting the opinion of proud Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours, That <hi>The Profit of the Earth</hi> belongs only to them. <hi>The Profit of the Earth is for All.</hi>

                  <p>IN this ſecond part of the Chapter he diſſwades from Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or the inordinat love of things Worldly, as one main hinderance in the way to Bleſſedneſs, concerning which he gave directions in the former part. And this he doth by ſeveral Reaſons: The <hi>First</hi> is, That there is no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a mans minde in things Worldly, whether <hi>Silver,</hi> under which is comprehended all Coin, or precious Mettal, for which men may get other neceſſaries, or <hi>Abundance,</hi> to wit, of any other earthly Commodity, though the ſame <hi>Increaſe</hi> to never ſo great a height: whence he inferrs, that for men to give away their hearts unto ſuch things, as their Happineſs, neglecting the way held forth in the former directions, <hi>is Vanity,</hi> that is, it proves to them, diſappointment, and emptineſs of Satisfaction. The <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon (which alſo proves the former) is, that as men grow in <hi>Riches</hi> of any ſort, ordinarily <hi>They are increaſed that Eat them,</hi> either their Children, Friends or Relations, are multiplied, or at leaſt Objects of Charity, upon whom Gods calls them to lay out ſome of their Subſtance, ſo as they cannot with a good Conſcience hoard up their Abundance: And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though they ſhould, they have no real Advantage by their ſo doing; even the Rich Maſter hath nothing more than the Poor Servant who hath Food and Raiment, except only the <hi>Naked ſight of what he hath,</hi> which is unworthy to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The Immoderat love of Riches is a ſin which hath its Judgement in the Boſom of it, the more any one
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51442:151"/>
attain of theſe things, the more inſatiable they are in thriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after more. The Lord hath given the Spirits of men ſo large Appetites, as nothing can ſatisfy them, but himſelf <hi>who is All in All,</hi> For <hi>he that loveth Silver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2, They that are moderat in their deſires after Worldly things, may get a ſatisfactory meaſure of them, and though that meaſure be but ſmall, they may account it ſufficient and beſt for them; yea if they have the true Riches, which are ſufficient for their Happinſs, even an intereſt in the Lord, they may be ſatisfied there with, For it is only <hi>He that loves Silver, and loves Abundance, that Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>ſhall not be ſatisfied with either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every adorer of <hi>Mammon,</hi> doth not lay out his love and deſires upon the ſame particular Objects, ſome worſhip <hi>Money;</hi> Others who more undervalue that, make their ſtore of <hi>Cattel,</hi> others their <hi>Merchandice,</hi> and others the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Ground, their Idol; Men cannot free themſelves of that ſin, though they be free of ſerving ſome particular Idoll that others ſerve, ſeing there are variety of Objects for the Covetous Man to pour out his heart upon, and all of them alike unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Therefore doth the wiſe man here ſpeak of not only <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> but the <hi>Abundance</hi> of any other earthly commodity, <hi>He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver, not he that loveth Abundance with increaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not only is the greateſt meaſure of <hi>Silver,</hi> or <hi>Abundance</hi> of other things that any can have unable to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the growing <hi>Increaſe</hi> of things of that nature, is as far from giving <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the heart of him that neglects to ſeek it in Gods favour and fellowſhip; For not only is he that loves <hi>Abundance,</hi> without any <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in the <hi>Abundance</hi> he hath, <hi>but he ſhall not be ſatisfied with Increaſe,</hi> Or a growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of more and more of that ſort.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a great proof of mens Vanity, and proves a great
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51442:151"/>
diſappointment and miſery to them in the end, that <hi>they ſpend then Money for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which ſatisfies not.</hi> For this is the Cenſure, and ſentence of the Spirit of God, paſt upon ſuch a courſe. <hi>This alſo is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. So unreaſonable is that luſt of Covetouſneſs, that it makes men who are under the power of it, apprehend <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to be had in that which could not but <hi>Increaſe</hi> their Anxiety if they had it. They imagine if there were none but themſelves to injoy things earthly, they would be happy, and if it were ſo, how miſerable would they be? For this their imagination is imported, while it is given for a Reaſon of their unſatisfaction, that the contrary of it comes to paſs, <hi>As goods increaſe, they are Increaſed that eat them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a clear mark of a Covetous Worldling who hath <hi>Mammon</hi> for his God, that he deſires to enhaunce all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cannot willingly give out any thing to an other though of neareſt Relation to him, or ſuch as God calls him to give out unto, without great Vexation, and Increaſe of his Unſatisfaction; For this is a Reaſon why His Abundance ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies him not, becauſe Providence orders it ſo, that <hi>When his Goods are increaſed, they are increaſed that eat them,</hi> And this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes</hi> the covetous mans Vexation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That which doth increaſe the contentment of a man mortified to the World, increaſes the Anxiety of a worſhipper of <hi>Mammon.</hi> It is a great comfort to a Child of God, when <hi>Abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the World is laid to his hand, that Providence offers him many fit Objects upon whom to imploy it; But to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Worldling it is a Vexation to ſee the number growing to whom he ought to give, and from whom he cannot with a good Conſcience withhold, and yet cannot get an heart to give, as is imported in this Reaſon of his unſatisfaction with his <hi>Increaſe,</hi> that <hi>when Goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eat them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. God doth never give a man Riches, and abundance of things Worldly, to hoard up beſide him, but when ſoever his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51442:152"/>
Providence brings in to him <hi>Abundantly</hi> of theſe things, the ſame Providence affords Objects upon whom he is bound to lay out a part thereof: Either his Children are multiplyed, or the number of his Servants and Followers is increaſed, or the Poor run and flock about him, or ſome occurrences of Providence, meet him, that will, if he do as he ought, <hi>eat up</hi> a conſiderable part of his increaſe; for this is a general truth, <hi>as Goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eat them.</hi>

                  <p>HEre are two farther Arguments to diſſwade from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love of things earthly; The one is taken from the advantage of moderate diligence about theſe things, <hi>The Sleep of a Labouring man is ſweet,</hi> ſaith he. By the <hi>Labouring man</hi> here ſpoken of, is meant mainly, 1. Such an one as for all his Labour hath but little of the World among his hands, as appears by this, that he is oppoſed to the <hi>Rich,</hi> who hath <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</hi> Yet 2. He is ſuch an one as is ſuppoſed to be La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring alſo for the true Riches, otherwiſe if he were a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Wretch, his want and care to get, would make him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet as the others <hi>Abundance,</hi> but being moderate in diligence
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51442:152"/>
about his outward calling, and ſerious in ſeeking the true Riches, he hath <hi>ſweet Sleep</hi> and Reſt both to Body and Spirit: and this he hath, though he have but a light Supper; his painful Labour, and his good Conſcience makes <hi>his Sleep refreſhful,</hi> and if he eat more, the Bleſſing of God upon his Healthy conſtitution, makes digeſtion eaſie, and ſo however it be with him, <hi>his Sleep is Sweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Argument is taken from that Anxiety which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily attends the <hi>Abundance</hi> of things Worldly, in thoſe who ſeek them as their beſt portion: <hi>But the Abundance of the Rich</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) will not ſuffer him to Sleep.</hi> By the <hi>Rich</hi> muſt be underſtood, not ſimply every man who hath <hi>Abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> for Godly Rich men, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were, have reſt to Body and Spirit allowed upon them; But the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Rich,</hi> who thorow exceſſive love to the World, cares and Anxieties about keeping, and fears of loſing, deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Lords allowance to men. And both the expreſſions in this verſe are to be underſtood of what doth <hi>Ordinarily</hi> fall out, ſeing the Lord may correct and exerciſe his own deareſt people with unquietneſs, and may and doth ſometimes plague the <hi>Rich</hi> with falſe peace, and reſt of Body and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Oftimes theſe who doth moſt painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly Labour in their Callings, remain <hi>Poor</hi> in things Worldly, not only becauſe ſuch are often preyed upon by <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours,</hi> but becauſe the Lord having provided better things for them, will have them by the want of theſe outward things ſtirred up to ſeek for better, and to depend upon him for their daily Bread; For, <hi>Solomon</hi> oppoſeth the honeſt <hi>Labourer</hi> to the <hi>Rich who hath Abundance,</hi> as if the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Labourer</hi> were one, as ordinarily they are, <hi>The ſleep of the Labouring man</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Abundance of the Rich,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Natural reſt or ſound Sleep, not interrupted by Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Body or Soul, is a ſweet Mercy of God, whereby men are ſeparat from the ſight and feeling of the Miſeries of this
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51442:153"/>
life; And the ſame being ſanctified, they are by it refreſhed, and recreated in Body and Spirit, for the farther ſervice of the Lord; For as a <hi>Sweet</hi> Bleſſing to the poor Labourer that fears God, it is here ſpoken of, <hi>The Sleep of the Labouring man is ſweet.</hi>
                  </p>

The conſideration whereof ſhould make men digeſt the pains of lawful diligence, and make them beware to take a ſurfet of it, or to marr the peace of their Conſcience, which may marr the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of their <hi>Rest</hi> and Sleep, which God allows upon them: For, it is of him who <hi>Labours</hi> painfully and moderatly, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſaith, <hi>The Sleep of a Labouring man is Sweet.</hi>

By comparing Mans caſe while he entereth into the World, with his condition in going out of it, that as he brought no Money, or Poſſeſſions into the World with him, ſo muſt he go out of it without them, and not carry ſo much as an handful with him, that can be of any uſe to him in the other World, he is ſaid <hi>to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> (as it were whence he came) becauſe he Goes in a manner back to an Eſtate like unto that which he was in, before he came into the World, as to his being deprived of worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, to the <hi>Womb</hi> of our <hi>Common Mother</hi> the Earth. 2. By regrating as it were the great guilt, and woful condition of Men who imbrace theſe things for their portion, which is to them a <hi>ſore Evil</hi> both of Sin and Puniſhment; And while he ſaith, <hi>In all points he muſt Go as he Came,</hi> it cannot be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation: For it is ſure the Covetous Worldling, though he take not a Farthing of his Money out of the World with him; yet he takes hence a load of Guilt, beſide what he brought into the World with him; but the meaning is <hi>In all points,</hi> as to his being ſtript of his worldly Poſſeſſions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he came Poor, Naked, and Weeping into the World, and ſo muſt he go out of it. And 3. By alarming the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this inconſiderat Worldling with a Queſtion, <hi>What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hath he,</hi> to wit, mainly at his Departure, <hi>in labouring for</hi> that, which he can no more hold faſt than the <hi>Wind,</hi> nor be more refreſhed with, than an hungry Man can be fed with the <hi>Wind.</hi> And this ſame Argument in ſubſtance is made uſe of by the Apoſtle to the ſame purpoſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51442:158"/>
in Chriſt, but a <hi>Temporary Portion,</hi> or reward of his Labour, carved out to him (as the word <hi>Portion</hi> ſignifies) for uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his outward man in his Maſters Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He ſhews that when God hath given to a man abundance of outward things, and hath withal ſuperadded this favour, that <hi>he hath given him power to uſe them,</hi> which conſiſts not only in a mans natural Health, whereby he is in a capacity to make uſe of creature comforts, but alſo in the freedom of his Spirit from Anxiety, Nigardlineſs, or ſcruples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in uſing them, ſo as he is not inſlaved to his Poſſeſſions but is made a Maſter or Lord of them (As the word, <hi>to give Power</hi> ſignifies) and hath Wiſdom to take them proportionally and ſutably to his Rank and Imployment, which is to take his <hi>Portion,</hi> and ſo chearfully to follow his Duty, Rejoicing that he is enabled for the ſame; <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a free Gift of God.</hi> to wit, a new Gift ſuperadded to all his wealth and Riches <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He giveth the Reaſon why men ſhould ſtudy this holy and chearful uſe of the Creatures, taken from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he ſhall have thereby, namely <hi>he ſhall not much remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the days of his Life,</hi> whereby is meant, that he ſhall not be vexed with the thoughts of his by-paſt croſſes, or ſolicitous how to wreſtle thorow his future: And that becauſe, while he follows his preſent duty chearfully, taking the Lords al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of outward comforts for that end, the Lord will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Prayers and pains, by giving him ſpiritual Joy, and making his heart glad in himſelf, and his allowance to him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Not only do the Lords people ſtand in need of direction how to go about Religious performances, but likewiſe how to uſe aright their common Comforts, even their meat, Drink and other refreſhments of that nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that they are in hazard to be taken with many ſnares in theſe, and that there is Communion to be had with God in the right uſe of them, as well as in Acts of immediat Worſhip:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51442:159"/>
And therefore it is a neceſſary part of a Miniſters work to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect peoples carriage herein: And people as they love their own peace, ſhould ſtudy the right uſe of theſe things. For after <hi>Solomon</hi> hath taught the right manner of worſhip in the firſt part of the Chapter, he comes here in the laſt, to ſet people upon the right way of uſing their common mercies. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is good for one to eat and to drink.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould be no leſs careful to point out the lawful liberty of the Lords people, and ſhew them how large his allowance to them is, even in the uſe of outward comforts, than to ſhew them the hazard of inordinat love to, and exceſs in the uſe of theſe things: and conſequently the Lords people ſhould be as careful to know, and take their allowance in the holy and chearful uſe of Creature comforts, as they ſhould be attentive leaſt they exceed in their love of, and delight in them, conſidering that Satan ſtudies to drive them from one extream, to another: And as he takes occaſion from their lawful liberty, to drive them to exceſs; So from the Doctrine of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially when it is ſtrained too high, or not qualified with the Doctrine of Chriſtian Liberty in the uſe of lawful comforts, either to make them look upon Religion, as a ſevere and rigid task, prejudicial to their natural life, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it, Or to make them without Ground ſcrupulous, and with fear and doubting to uſe theſe things, which, if they knew the Lords allowance, and the right way of uſing them, they might uſe with a quiet and good Conſcience. Therefore the Spirit of the Lord, after he hath directed <hi>Solomon</hi> by many Arguments to diſſwade from the inordinat love of Riches, in the ſecond part of this Chapter, he brings him in the cloſe, to commend the Holy and comfortable uſe of the Creatures. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that which I have ſeen, it is good and comely for one to eat and drink and injoy Good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though the pretence of the beſt mens Experience of the good of any courſe, be a very ſlender commendation of it, if
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51442:159"/>
there be no farther, ſeing men are ſo eaſily deceived; Yet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould put truths they hold forth to the Trial of their own Experience, and ſhould be very careful Obſervers what true advantage may be found in any courſe or practice they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that they themſeves may taſte of it, and ſee it, and ſo may with greater Zeal and confidence call others to try the ſame, and their commendation of it coming thorow a heart ſeaſoned with the ſweetneſs thereof, it may be the ſweeter to them, that hath their ſenſes exerciſed. For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this way from his own Experience: <hi>Behold that which I have ſeen, it is good and comely,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though nothing lower than the injoyment of the Ever-bleſſed God, be a mans chief good, yet there is a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat inferiour Good, in the right uſe of the moſt common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, ſuch as <hi>Meat, Drink</hi> and the like, in ſo far as the ſame are uſed to keep the Body in health and ſtrength, and to chear the natural Spirits in doing the Lord ſervice; For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>he ſaw this,</hi> that <hi>it is good for a man to eat and Drink</hi> &amp;c. to wit, in this ſenſe, and for this end.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the hearty, chearful and holy uſe of allowed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, is a thing that beautifies Religion, and makes Chriſtians lovely to Onlookers, ſo are they bound to ſtudy the ſame for that very end, and not to look only to what is good for themſelves, but alſo to what is Comely to others, or may allure and gain them to fall in love with the way of Religion. For <hi>Solomon</hi> here commends the Holy and chearful uſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed comforts from this, that as <hi>it is Good</hi> to the perſon ſo uſing them, ſo it is Comely to others: Behold (ſaith he) <hi>that which I have ſeen, that it is good</hi> (to wit, for a mans ſelf mainly) and <hi>Comely</hi> (or as the word ſignifies <hi>Beautiful,</hi> namely in the ſight of others) <hi>that a man ſhould Eat and Drink, and injoy the good of his Labour.</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51442:160"/>
from <hi>Labour</hi> of one ſort or other, nor can any chearfully and with a good Conſcience, take the comfort of Gods Creatures, who being in a capacity to Labour, and having the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, neglects the ſame, and ſo loves to live upon the good of other mens Labours, and not his own, (for ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) It is <hi>good and Comely that a man ſhould Eat and Drink,</hi> but in ſo doing he ſhould ſee that he <hi>Injoy the Good</hi> of his own Labour, which He takes <hi>under the Sun</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As there is no day of a mans Life, wherein he is able to Labour excepting the days which are the Lords, to wit the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and other days ſet a part for his Worſhip, wherein he is exeemed from ſome lawful and honeſt <hi>Labour;</hi> So mans <hi>Painful Labour</hi> (as the Word ſignifies) is only during this Life, <hi>under the Sun,</hi> his reſt from his Labour is <hi>above the Sun,</hi> whether his <hi>Works ſhall follow him.</hi> For (ſaith <hi>Solomon) It is good for a man to Eat and Drink and injoy the Good of his Labour,</hi> which he takes <hi>under the Sun, all the dayes of his Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. As every day of a Mans Life ſhould be taken for a new Gift of God, and ſo ſhould be ſpent in Honouring and ſerving him, ſo all the <hi>Good</hi> which he <hi>Injoys</hi> of his <hi>Labour,</hi> ſhould be looked upon as a Gift of God alſo, though the ſame be acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by never ſo much Labour of his, ſeing the ſtrength to Labour, and the ſucceſs of Labour is from the Lord, for this clauſe, <hi>(which God giveth him)</hi> may be ſafely referred, either to the <hi>Good</hi> of his <hi>Labour,</hi> which he takes, or to the <hi>days of his Life, under the Sun,</hi> wherein he Labours and Injoys that Good, both <hi>which God giveth him.</hi>

As they that have abundance of the World, have but a part thereof allowed upon them for their own uſe, there being ſeveral parts thereof appropriat by the Lord for other uſes, ſome for the poor <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.2. ſome for publick Religious Uſes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 23.18. ſome for mens near Relations 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51442:160"/>
he may uſe comfortably, ſhould be the main Ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he takes comfort in the uſe thereof. For this word <hi>(his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> ſignifies that part which is ſeparat from other parts of the Fruit of his <hi>Labour,</hi> and is given as a Reaſon why he ſhould take that chearfully, ſeing it is carved out to him by the Lord, <hi>For this is his Portion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. As mens Wealth and Riches are Gods Gift, So <hi>the power to uſe theſe</hi> for ſtrengthening them in his ſervice is a ſecond <hi>Gift,</hi> and Wiſdom to take their own due <hi>Portion,</hi> neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding themſelves of their own allowance, nor others to whom they are bound to give a part of theirs, is a third <hi>Gift:</hi> And the Grace to comfort themſelves in ſo doing is a Fourth. And ſo the Lord ſhould be acknowledged and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for our daily Bread, for our Appetite after it, for the heart to take and uſe it, for Wiſdom and Grace, to take nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs than our own allowance of it, and to take that chearfully: For we find many Gifts here ſpoken of, <hi>every man to whom God hath given Wealth,</hi> and hath <hi>given</hi> him power to eat, and to take his Portion, and to Rejoice, this is the <hi>Gift</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Men may have a right to <hi>Abundance</hi> of Riches, and have them in their poſſeſſion alſo, and yet not to be <hi>Masters</hi> of any thing they have, but held as Captives to their Wealth, and not be <hi>able to uſe it:</hi> For this expreſſion, <hi>And hath given him power to Eat thereof,</hi> is in the Original, to make him <hi>Master</hi> or Lord, or give him the Dominion over what he hath, This muſt be a <hi>New Gift</hi> of God, ſuperadded to his <hi>Abundance,</hi> elſe it doth him no good.</p>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having by many Arguments diſſwaded from the inordinate love of things <hi>Earthly,</hi> and commended the Holy and cheerful uſe of outward Comforts, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter; He doth here proceed in the enlargement of the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And for this end he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> by way of regrate, diſcover more of the Sin and Miſery of the Covetous Wretch, while he ſaith, <hi>There is an evil which I have ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Evil</hi> he ſpeaks of is to be taken mainly for the evil of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> (expreſt in the ſecond Verſe) as preſuppoſing the evil of <hi>Sin</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man. And this <hi>Evil</hi> he deſcribes 1. As very clearly <hi>obſerved</hi> by him in his own Experience. And 2. As very <hi>Common</hi> and frequent <hi>Among Men</hi> in all places where the <hi>Sun</hi> riſes and ſets.</p>
                  <p>Next, He ſuppoſes this Covetous Miſer to have his Idol in his Poſſeſſion, and ſhews what his Attainments may be. 1. By
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51442:163"/>
ſpecifying his prime Idols, as <hi>Riches</hi> of all ſorts, great <hi>Honour</hi> and Eſteem in the World. And 2. By a general Expreſſion <hi>He wants nothing of what his Soul deſires,</hi> Not as if the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſires of the Covetous could ever be ſatisfied, but that <hi>He wants nothing</hi> of the things themſelves for the Subſtance of them, wherein he apprehends his Happineſs to ly. And theſe things God is ſaid to <hi>Give</hi> him, not in Love and Approbation of his <hi>Deſires,</hi> but in the courſe of his common Providence, and in his diſpleaſure, as appears by what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſhews wherein God manifeſts even in time, his juſt diſpleaſure againſt ſuch a mans ſin of Covetouſneſs in two Branches. <hi>First,</hi> He <hi>Hath not power to Eat</hi> of what he hath. By <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> muſt be underſtood the Injoyment of the Comfort of his Wealth. 1. Becauſe according to the Grammatical conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Words, it relates to his <hi>Honour</hi> as well as his <hi>Riches.</hi> And 2. Becauſe he could not ſubſiſt, if all Power to Eat were taken away from him: <hi>Next,</hi> that <hi>A Stranger Eats it.</hi> By the <hi>Stranger</hi> is meant one who is of no near Relation to him, or one who is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to him, as the Word is uſed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.15, 17. Both which proofs of Gods diſpleaſure, are not to be underſtood as if they were let forth upon every Covetous Man; ſeing many ſuch <hi>have Power</hi> to take largely of their Riches for their own uſe, and <hi>leave the reſt to their Babes,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. But they are to be underſtood as frequently verified, in ſo much as many inſtances may be given thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He doth again paſs Cenſure upon the condition and courſe of the Covetous, that <hi>it is Vanity,</hi> or wholly <hi>Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> and <hi>Emptineſs of Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>an evil Diſeaſe,</hi> that is, a Spiritual <hi>Plague</hi> upon him, ſpending both his Body and his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>From this Learn 1. White the Lords Miniſters are opening up his ſweet and comfortable Allowance to his People, they ſhould not forget to mention the Miſery of them that are by their Sins depriving themſelves of it, but ſhould with Pitie and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51442:163"/>
Compaſſion regrate the ſame in their Hearing, that thereby ſuch may be moved to reſent the wofulneſs of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For this Heavenly Preacher, who is in this a Pattern to all others, having in the cloſe of the former Chapter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Lords comfortable Allowance to his own; he here as it were regrates the Sin and Miſery of others, while he ſaith, <hi>There is an Evil which I have ſeen under the Sun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Miniſters muſt not only ſtudy to know what things are Sinful, and what Judgements are due to them in the general, that from the word they may <hi>clearly diſcover</hi> both; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ought to be much in the Obſervation of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sins that reign and prevail moſt among Men in their time, and of the particular Judgements, whereby God teſtifies his diſpleaſure againſt them, that from their own experimental Obſervation of both, they may diſcover them to People: For it is mainly of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s own <hi>Obſervation</hi> and experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this <hi>Evil,</hi> which comprehends both that particular Sin of Mens ſeeking things <hi>Earthly</hi> for their Portion; and that particular Judgement of God, whereby he deprives them of comfort of theſe things, that he here ſpeaks, while he ſaith, <hi>There is an Evil which I have ſeen under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are many Sins frequently committed by Men, and many Plagues frequently inflicted by the Lord upon them for theſe Sins, which ſinners themſelves do not ſee nor conſider, and therefore Chriſts Miniſters ſhould eſpecially diſcover theſe Sins and Judgements, which they do not ſee, or do not eſteem to be ſuch; for Men ſtand in need of the Spirits Information, that there is ſuch an <hi>Evil</hi> as this <hi>common among Men,</hi> to wit, their exceſſive love of the World, which is their Sin, and Gods depriving them of the comfort of it even while they have it, which is their Plague: And therefore it is here given them, <hi>There is an Evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, and it is common among Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord may multiply outward Favours of all ſorts,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51442:164"/>
upon them whom he Favours not; he may bring to their hand <hi>All that their Hearts can deſire;</hi> And in ſo doing, be raining ſnares upon them. And ſurely it is ſo when Men deſire theſe things as their chief good, and when Saving Grace is not given with them, and wiſdom to uſe them aright; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks here of the <hi>Covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth,</hi> Pſal. 10 3. And yet he is, <hi>A man to whom God hath given Riches, Wealth, Honour, and what his Soul deſireth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the Lord hath given to Men great Variety of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings, even anſwerable <hi>to their own deſires,</hi> he hath it in his own hand, whether he will give or withhold the Comfort and Sweetneſs of the Injoyment of theſe things. And this he doth often withhold; ſometimes by leaving them to their own Covetous Diſpoſition; which binds up their Hands that they cannot uſe what they have, had they never ſo much, for fear of want afterward: And ſometimes by ſtriking them with his Terrour and Wrath in the midſt of their Injoyments, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.30, 31. So that after the greateſt variety of moſt deſirable Bleſſings is obtained, the <hi>Power to uſe them</hi> ſhould be ſought; and that being alſo obtained, ſhould be thankfully acknowledged, as a new and more excellent Mercy than all the reſt: For ſaith <hi>Solomon, There is a man to whom God hath given Riches, Wealth and Honour, ſo that he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that his Soul deſires; and yet he giveth him not Power to Eat thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord often ſtrikes wicked men ſoreſt in theſe things, and at theſe Seaſons that they leaſt expect. They apprehend all the difficulty in the way to their Happineſs to be in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to things Earthly, and yet the diſappointment is after all is gotten that <hi>their Soul deſired:</hi> For, <hi>there is a man to whom God hath given Riches Wealth and Honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing of all that his Soul deſireth, and yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. When Mens Hearts are eſtranged from God, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with earthly Delights, it is but juſt with Him to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51442:164"/>
make Strangers conſume their Idols, which they have ſet up in His room; So that when Men do immoderately love and ſeek after theſe things, they take the neareſt courſe not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the Comfort of them, but their Poſterity alſo, whoſe proviſion they have preferred to the Favour of God, and the good of their own Souls: For this is another way, whereby God teſtifies His Diſpleaſure againſt the Sin of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, <hi>A Stranger eats it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is a vain thing for Men to place Happineſs in theſe things, which when they are given, the Power to uſe them, or take comfort in them, may be with-held: And it is Wiſdom to ſeek after the true Riches and Honour, Reconciliation with God, His Grace and Favour; which being beſtowed, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to feell the ſweetneſs of, and take comfort in them, will not be altogether with-held: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> cenſure Mens ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wealth, Riches and Honour, as their Portion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had, they may want Power to take Comfort in them. <hi>This is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Men in love with the World as their Happineſs, are in a dreadful Diſtemper of Spirit, and ſhould look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as infected with ſome loathſome and deadly <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> even ſuch an one as they cannot be ſenſible of till it be paſt Remedy, except a Miracle of Grace be wrought upon them: For this is another part of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Cenſure of the Covetous Mans caſe, <hi>It is an evil Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The obſervation of this <hi>Vanity, Diſappointment</hi> and <hi>Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> incident to <hi>Mammon-worſhipers,</hi> ſhould elevat the Hearts of Men above the Sun, and make them long to be where the true Riches and Honour are, and where the Power to take the Comfort thereof is never with-held, nor interrupted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it: For <hi>this Evil</hi> is only obſerved <hi>under the Sun,</hi> that a Man may have <hi>Wealth, Riches and Honour, and no power to eat thereof,</hi> and is here held forth to alienat Mens Hearts from this Earth, which is one principal part of the ſcope of this Book.</p>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> doth farther illuſtrate the Sin and Miſery of the Covetous Worldling, whoſe Portion is in this preſent Life.</p>
                  <p>And for this end he <hi>Firſt</hi> ſuppoſes ſuch an one to have yet two farther Degrees of his fancied Happineſs. The 1. is, A numerous Off-ſpring to poſſeſs what he hath gathered, <hi>If a Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beget an hundred Children,</hi> he puts a definit number for an indefinit, an Hundred for many, according to an ordinary way of ſpeaking in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.13. And by ſuppoſing him to be in a caſe which is not poſſible, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to awake him out of his Dream of finding Happineſs in a caſe far inferiour to that which is ſuppoſed. The 2. is a long Life, <hi>If he live</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>many years, ſo that the days of his years be many,</hi> by doubling the Expreſſion, he ſuppoſes his days and years to be as many as ever any had, or can have: So he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes him to have theſe things which he pretends as a Defence of his eager purſuit, and ſparing uſe of things worldly, to wit, many Children to leave theſe things to, and Old Age to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He ſuppoſes the Covetous Man to want other two things. 1. That <hi>his Soul injoys no good,</hi> that is, He neither hath the comfortable uſe of his Riches, nor doth he make ſure
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51442:165"/>
any Spiritual or Eternal Good to himſelf. And 2. That <hi>he hath no Burial:</hi> He ſuppoſes him to want Burial, not as if all Covetous Wretches were deprived of this favour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. Nor as if the having of it could in the leaſt contribute to their Happineſs; but becauſe Covetous and Ambitious Men do oft make more preparation for a ſumptuous <hi>Burial,</hi> than for their Eternal Wel-being, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.16. And becauſe none of them can be certain if ever they ſhall have <hi>Burial,</hi> ſeing the Lord ſometimes in diſpleaſure deprives the Wicked thereof, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.19. Therefore he ſuppoſes them to want it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon ſuppoſition that he have the former, and want the latter priviledge, he doth aſſert (v. 3) and ſet forth his Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by comparing with, and preferring to his caſe, the caſe of an <hi>untimely Birth,</hi> as <hi>Better</hi> in outward Reſpects ſpecified afterward; for of the future eternal ſtate of the <hi>Abortive</hi> he ſpeaks nothing, though the worſt that can be ſuppoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be more tolerable than the Covetous Mans.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He ſhews particularly, wherein the Miſery of the Covetous is greater then the <hi>Ab ortives.</hi> As for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous 1. <hi>He comes into the World with Vanity,</hi> that is to no good purpoſe for himſelf; or rather he comes in with a load of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Guilt, which is not to be underſtood, as if there were any who are not born in the ſame caſe, but becauſe it is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him now going out of the World, therefore he ſpeaks of it as peculiar to him. Then 2. His Death here called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,</hi> is comfortleſs and an entrance into utter <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> And 3. For his Reputation or <hi>Name,</hi> in the perpetuating whereof he placed one part of his Earthly Happineſs, that ſhall not be <hi>Remembred</hi> with God or good Men, for any advantage to him. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And for the <hi>Abortive,</hi> who hath not had the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Benefits of this Life, to <hi>ſee the Sun,</hi> or to have the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Reaſon, and ſo is not guilty of Abuſing theſe and the like Favours, as the Covetous is, <hi>this hath more reſt than the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous;</hi> Not as if properly ſuch an one could be ſaid to have any
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:51442:166"/>
reſt in this World, or as if the Covetous could have the leaſt degree of true Reſt; as the comparing of them would ſeem to import, but that this <hi>untimely Birth</hi> is never vexed with ſuch diſtracting Cares and Fears, as the Covetous Worldling is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He inlarges the Suppoſition of the Covetous mans long Life, by ſuppoſing that which is impoſſible, to wit, that he ſhould have <hi>a Thouſand years twice told</hi> ſuperadded to all his other Earthly advantages of <hi>Riches, Honour, numerous Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring</hi> and the like, and this he doth that he may drive him from the apprehenſion of Happineſs in any thing that he can attain to in this World.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he proves by ſeveral Reaſons that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this long Life, with all the forementioned advantages of it, he is ſtill a miſerable man, providing he ſeek not Happineſs of a higher nature than can be had in things Earthly, The <hi>Firſt</hi> Reaſon is, that he remains all his time a Stranger to the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fellowſhip with God: It is ſafe to underſtand <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo here, while he ſaith, <hi>he hath ſeen no good,</hi> ſeing he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Father, that mans true good conſiſts in that Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. The <hi>Second</hi> is, that this man ſuppoſed to be ſo near his imaginary Happineſs, muſt go to the ſame <hi>Place</hi> with the <hi>Abortive,</hi> or thoſe he Judges moſt miſerable, he muſt meet with them in the <hi>Grave</hi> or <hi>State of the Dead,</hi> which is here call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>One Place</hi> whether <hi>All</hi> men go: And ſo what ever it be belonging to this Life only, that differenceth one man from another, that cannot make him a happy Man, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Men deſtitute of ſaving Wiſdom are very Ingenious to find out pretences and ſeeming Excuſes for their ſinful Courſes, and therefore they that would reclaim ſuch, muſt trace them thorow theſe, and diſcover the Vanity of them. For <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſuppoſeth the Covetous Worldling ſwelling in Riches, to cover his exceſſive love to the World, and his depriving himſelf of lawful comforts with the pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51442:166"/>
for his numerous Off-ſpring, and his Old Age, and proves that neither of theſe doth leſſen his Sin or his Miſery: For ſaith he, <hi>Though he have an hundred Children, and live many years,</hi> &amp;c. Yet he is but a miſerable Caitif.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord may manifeſt his Bounty to wicked men by heaping upon them the choice of outward Bleſſings, and may draw out his long ſuffering patience toward them in great length, by giving them <hi>many Days</hi> and <hi>Years</hi> while they are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to him, that by his ſo doing he may reclaim ſome of them, and make the reſt the more inexcuſable: For having before ſuppoſed the Covetous man to have abundance of all ſorts of Riches, he here ſuppoſes him to have many <hi>Children,</hi> and to live <hi>many Years,</hi> ſo <hi>that the days of his Years be many.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>THeſe words contain ſeveral Arguments to diſſwade from the immoderat Love, and eager Purſuit of things earthly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, That the contented uſe of what a Man enjoys, were it never ſo little, is much better for him, than the <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Deſire,</hi> or (as the Word is) the <hi>Walking</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> ſtill after more, which is the Covetous Man's Diſeaſe; So that by <hi>the fight of his Eyes,</hi> is meant, The enjoyment of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51442:170"/>
what a Man hath to be ſeen, or in his poſſeſſion, as the word is tranſlated before Chap. 3.13. And it is thus expreſt to ſhew the ſhort continuance of our earthly Injoyments, they are <hi>but a Sight:</hi> And by the <hi>wandering of the Deſire</hi> (as is clear by the like Expreſſions in Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. and 14.10.) is meant the endleſs Purſuit of the Affections inſatiat with what they have, and greedily hunting after more of things earthly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> which proves the former is, that this, namely the <hi>wandering of the Deſire,</hi> is a courſe empty of all Satisfaction, as the Word <hi>Vanity</hi> ſignifies, and ſo proves Man vain that ſhould ſeek Satisfaction in it; and not only ſo, but in God's Righteous Judgement proves a Tormenting, and eating up of a Man's Spirit, as the word <hi>Vexation</hi> ſignifies, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, That <hi>whatever hath been</hi> formerly found by any, particularly, whatever the iſſue and ſucceſs of their inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Deſires, and exceſſive pains for Happineſs in the Creatures hath been, It <hi>is named already,</hi> that is, it is clearly expreſt in the words immediatly preceeding to be <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Vexation of Spirit;</hi> And <hi>it is known,</hi> that is, it may be clearly known, and is known to all Spiritual Diſcerners, <hi>that it is Man,</hi> to whom <hi>Vanity</hi> is to be imputed, <hi>it is Man,</hi> one piece of <hi>Red-Earth</hi> (as his Name ſignifies) <hi>ſeeking Happineſs in another,</hi> and get what he will, he is a frail dying <hi>Man</hi> ſtill: And ſo this that hath been told, hath been the conſtant courſe which God hath kept with Man, according to His eternal Purpoſe (and there cannot be an inſtance given to the contrary) that whoever ſought Happineſs in the Creatures, have meet with Vanity and Vexation of Spirit in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Reaſon is, That Man being ſo frail a Creature <hi>may not Contend,</hi> it is not ſafe for him; And he doth ſo if he ſeek Happineſs where God hath declared he ſhall not find it; he may not be in contradictory terms with Him, as the word <hi>Contend,</hi> ſignifies, or if he will yet eſſay it, he ſhall find the Lord <hi>Mightier than he,</hi> to Oppoſe, Diſappoint and Vex him.</p>

                  <p n="2">2: As men ſhould look upon all their earthly Injoyments as tranſitory, and things whereof they have but a <hi>View,</hi> as is imported in this, that they are called <hi>The ſight of the Eyes,</hi> ſo ought they to be content with the Portion which God gives them, and to look upon the ſame as more for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſerving more for their incouragement in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſervice, than if it were greater: For (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the ſight of the Eyes than the wandering of the Deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wandering of Man's Deſire from one Creature to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for ſatisfaction, proves all the Creatures to be empty of any thing that can give him true Contentment, and Man himſelf to be meer Vanity, that ſhould perſiſt in that vain purſuit: For in both theſe reſpects, this ſentence may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>The wandering of the Deſire, this alſo is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If after clear warning, and frequent diſappointment of deſired Contentment in things earthly, Men will ſtill follow their own vain courſes, they ſhall find the reſult to be, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more <hi>Diſappointment,</hi> but <hi>Torment</hi> and <hi>Eating</hi> of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits here, when God awakes their Conſcience, and if they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, a Worm that never dies, to eat up their Spirits eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: For it is the Lord that paſſes this Sentence, <hi>The wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Deſire is both Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Both the conſtant experience of all by-paſt Ages, and the clear Light of the Word of God, hath proven this Truth, that the purſuit of Happineſs in the Earth proves <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51442:171"/>
of Spirit</hi> to the Purſuer; So that none can give an Inſtance to the contrary: And this ſhould diſſwade Men from that way. For as another conſideration for that effect <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which hath been</hi> (to wit hitherto in all Ages the reſult of ſuch vain courſes) <hi>is named alread,</hi> that is, it is called by the Spirit of the Lord, by that name formerly expreſt, <hi>Vanity and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whatever is ſpoken of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the Creatures in order to Mans Happineſs, is not ſo much to be attributed to them, ſeing they are all good, and ſufficient for the ends to which they are appointed, and do groan that they ſhould be ſubjected by Man to Vanity; As it is to be attributed to vain Man: It is not the Creatures fault that they diſappoint Man of ſatisfaction, ſeing they were not appointed to terminat his deſires, or to ſatisfy him, but to lead him to his Creator, nor is it their fault that they prove <hi>Vexation</hi> to him, but his that vexes himſelf in ſeeking what they are not able, nor were ever appointed to give: And ſo all is to be fathered upon vain Man, <hi>It is known to be Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. While Men ſeek Happineſs in things beſide God, they do but <hi>Contend</hi> with Him, or (as the Word ſignifies) they <hi>enter in Judgement</hi> with Him, as if they would paſs ſentence contrary to His Decree and revealed Mind in His Word, which is, That Creatures are <hi>empty</hi> of Satisfaction, that Man is vain to ſeek it in them, and that the Lord Himſelf is the only ſatisfying Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His People, <hi>Neither may he Contend with Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. If man conſidered what his Name ſignifies, to wit, <hi>Adam a piece of the Earth,</hi> that was taken out of it, and muſt go to it, and that all his Injoyments cannot change him, but ſtill he muſt be <hi>Adam,</hi> a <hi>Frail dying piece of red Clay,</hi> it would make him afraid to enter the liſts with, or take up a ſute of Law (as the word <hi>Contend,</hi> ſignifies) againſt his Maker, about the way of attaining to Happineſs; For there may be ſafely conceived a conſideration held forth in his Name, to diſſwade him from
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51442:172"/>
that courſe, which is a <hi>Contending</hi> with God. <hi>It is known to be Man, neither may he contend with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Who ever walk contrary to the Lord ſhall find him <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> then they, to blaſt their Courſes, and deſtroy themſelves, except they ſubmit in time, and follow his way: <hi>Neither may be Contend with Him that is Mightier than he.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN theſe words <hi>Solomon</hi> doth <hi>Firſt</hi> reſume his former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, while he ſaith, <hi>Seing there be many things that increaſe Vanity,</hi> the meaning is, ſeing there are ſo many vain Courſes, that naturally Men take for attaining to Happineſs in the Earth, and ſo many juſt Diſpenſations of God, whereby he diſappoints them, as hath been ſhewn in the former purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Next,</hi> He draws ſeveral inferences therefrom, which may alienat Mens Hearts from things Earthly; And theſe he holds forth in three Queſtions. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>What is man the better?</hi> The meaning whereof is, he is not the nearer to his Happineſs, for the Queſtion hath the force of a Negation, yea it imports that he is much the worſe, and much farther from his Happineſs, than if he had never attempted to ſeek it in theſe Courſes. The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>Who knows what is good for Man in this Life?</hi> &amp;c. Which imports not only that Man is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what Condition in the World, whether to be Rich or Poor, to be in Honour or Obſcurity, makes moſt for the ſatisfaction of the Mind which he aims at; But mainly that there is not one of the Children of Men, till he get <hi>Eye ſalve</hi> from Chriſt, that can <hi>Know</hi> or inform another, wherein the true
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51442:172"/>
Good (which is only in Fellowſhip with God) doth conſiſt; far leſs how to attain unto it. And to this he ſubjoins ſuch a Deſcription of Mans Life from the brevitie and incertainty of it, as may teach him not to ſeek Happineſs in things on Earth. The <hi>Third</hi> is, <hi>Who can tell him what ſhall be after him?</hi> The meaning whereof is, that not only future Events, which may befal a Man before he depart this Life, are hid from him, or others that might inform him, ſo that his Happineſs cannot be here: But mainly that none can inform a Man how theſe things upon which he ſpends his Body, Spirit, and time, ſhall be imployed after him, whether his lawful Heirs or Strangers ſhall poſſeſs them, whether they ſhall be imployed well or not, by either. Which conſideration though it be true alſo in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Godly, yet it is only a Vexation to them who know not of a better Life, and who place much of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in perpetuating their own Fame, and ſecuring great things to their Succeſſours.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. As they who have a calling to deliver the Mind of God to his Church, ought to propoſe ſome certain ſcope to themſelves, to which they ſhould make all that they deliver ſubſervient, ſo it is not in vain for them after proof and clearing thereof, to reſume and repeat the ſame, eſpecially when they are therefrom to draw ſome practical uſes, which may be profitable for their Hearers: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> who is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for our ordinary way of Preaching, having in the entry propoſed this for one main part of his Scope in this Book, to prove all created Things, and humane Courſes about them vain and inſufficient for bringing Man to true Happineſs, he doth here, as in ſeveral other places of this Book, recapitulat and repeat the ſame, and draw ſeveral Uſes from it, Seing there are ſo <hi>many things that increaſe Vanity, what is man the better.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Till men be ſet upon the new and living way of true Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which is the ſtudy of Reconciliation with God thro' the Blood of Chriſt <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. their Sin and Miſery is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51442:173"/>
ſtill upon the growing hand, the more they multiply their Courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for Happineſs, the more Sinful and Miſerable do they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves, if they ſeek it not where it is be found, as is imported in this firſt Queſtion drawn from the former purpoſe here reſumed, <hi>Seing there are ſo many things that increaſe Vanity, what is Man the better?</hi> i.e. he is much the worſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though fallen Man by all his pains about things Earthly, can come nothing nearer his loſt Happineſs, but on the contrary is ſtill put to a greater and greater diſtance from it, yet is he very unwilling to caſt up his Account, and conſider what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or loſe he hath by his pains, he muſt be put to this by the word and Meſſengers of God: For this Queſtion imports that <hi>he is nothing the better,</hi> but much the worſe of the many vain Courſes he takes for Happineſs, and that he cannot conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon his Advantage, though he apprehend it to be very great, <hi>Seing there are ſo many things that increaſe Vanity, what is Man the better?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men without renewing Grace, are not only unable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto any thing that is truely good for them, by all their Pains, but they are alſo Blind and cannot ſee that Good, till they get <hi>Eye-Salve</hi> which is vouchſafed but upon a very few: For this Queſtion is put concerning all men in nature, <hi>Who</hi> (of them) <hi>knows what is good for Man in this Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Cauſe why Men are not the <hi>Better</hi> of their Pains for Happineſs, is their Ignorance of the nature of that true Good which is attainable in this Life, conſiſting only in Obedience to Gods Commands, and ſubmiſſion to his Correction <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26.27. in Praiſing of him for his Goodneſs <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92, 1. And ſo injoying fellowſhip with him <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. and the like, what wonder then men know not what is their Good in the other Life? For this Queſtion may be looked upon as containing the Reaſon of that which is imported in the former, that Man is nothing the <hi>Better</hi> by the vain Courſes he takes for Happineſs, <hi>For who knows what is good for Man in this Life.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:51442:173"/>6. That only is to be eſteemed truely Good for a Man in this Life, which can continue with him, and may be Injoyed by him all the Days of his Life, whether he be in adverſity, or proſperity; And that is only to be in Favour with God, the proofs whereof his Favourites may promiſe to themſelves ſhall follow them all their days <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. For it is clearly imported here, that if Man know not what is Good for him <hi>All</hi> the days <hi>of his Life,</hi> he doth not know what is truely Good for him in <hi>this Life</hi> at all. <hi>Who knows what is Good for a Man in this Life all the days of his Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Mans natural Life, and duration here is extreamly <hi>Vain,</hi> being ſo ſhort and uncertain, much like a <hi>Shadow,</hi> that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Darkneſs, and never continues in one poſture, but ſoon changes and ſoon evaniſhes, which ought to be often conſidered as a mean to draw Mans heart from ſeeking Happineſs here, and move him to provide for a better Life: For, ſo is his Life and time here ſet forth, <hi>a Vain Life,</hi> and <hi>Days which he ſpends as</hi> a <hi>Shadow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. As Men whoſe Hearts are wedded to things Earthly, before they ſeek any other Happineſs than what the Earth can afford, they will place it in providing for theſe they are to leave behind them, or in keeping up their own Memory among Men after themſelves are gone; So the Lord hath wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hid from all of them the knowledge of future Events con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, wherein they might obſerve his Mercy toward them. For if they ſhould know things to go well after them, and better than in their own time, they would but vex themſelves the more, to think that they cannot ſtay with them, or if they ſhould know them to be worſe, they would but vex themſelves with thinking upon the condition of thoſe whom they are to leave behind them: Therefore even this ſhould be eſteemed a Mercy, and ſhould wean Mans Heart from this World as his Portion, in that he knows not how things ſhall go after himſelf is gone. <hi>Who can tell him what ſhall be after him?</hi>

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:51442:174"/>9. It is fit for awakening the Conſciences of Men, to poſe them with pertinent and rational Queſtion, including an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in their Boſom, which readily Natures light it ſelf, or common Reaſon will ſuggeſt to Mens minds: For ſo doth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> Catechize the vain Worldling, ſeeking his Happineſs in the Earth, by theſe three Queſtions, <hi>What is Man the better? Who knows what is good for him? Who can tell him what ſhall be after him?</hi>

                  <p>THE Preacher in the <hi>Firſt</hi> part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> to <hi>verſe 23.</hi> Doth highly commend ſome things as very fit Remedies againſt that diſquiet of Spirit which is occaſioned by the oppreſſion of the wicked; and ſo proving proper means to bring them nearer to their true Happineſs and Contentment of Mind. As <hi>I.</hi> He commendeth (as the firſt Remedy againſt diſcontent of Mind, which marrs true Happineſs). That <hi>good Name</hi> or high eſteem with God, and ſavoury report with Men, founded upon Grace and true Holineſs, as better than the moſt precious things in the World, wherein moſt men place their Happineſs. And <hi>The day of the Death</hi> of ſuch as preferable unto the day of their Birth, <hi>ver. 1.</hi> Upon which occaſion he alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends (as a fit preparation for Death) the frequenting thoſe Places, Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Societies where the remembrance of Death is offered, as better than haunting theſe Houſes and Opportunities where Feaſting and other Carnal Pleaſures abound: And that becauſe Death (which theſe mournful Places and Companies bringeth to our Mind) putteth an end to this Temporal Life and all its Comforts and Croſſes, which will readily occaſion the ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the living (unleſs plagued with ſtupidity) as a fit means of preparing for Death. <hi>ver. 2. II.</hi> He praiſeth that ſoft and tender frame of heart, which the ſanctified conſideration of Death begets in the Soul, beyond that Carnal mirth and joy which is ordinarily expreſſed by <hi>Laughter,</hi> and other ſuch like Geſtures and this as the ſecond Remedy againſt diſquiet of Mind, the great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of true Happineſs <hi>ver. 3.</hi> And that on the Account <hi>1.</hi> That the grave and humble Deportment of the outward Man, flowing from Godly Sorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:51442:174"/>
contributes not a little unto working of their own and others Hearts unto a promiſing frame for receiving and retaining true Peace and Contentment. <hi>ver. 3.</hi> And <hi>2.</hi> That it is the allowed Diſpoſition of thoſe who are endued with ſaving Wiſdom (whatever be their own particular Caſe) to have their Thoughts much taken up with ſuch mournful Objects and Occaſions, for keeping themſelves in a humble and ſympathizing frame. And on the contrary the fool, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man; tho he be not bodily preſent, yet hath his heart ſtill in the Places and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Carnal Joy and Pleaſures, whereby he is miſerably diverted from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of Death and Eternity. <hi>ver. 4. III.</hi> He commendeth (as a third Remedy againſt that trouble of Mind which marrs true Happineſs) an humble ſubmiſſion unto the ſerious and wiſe Rebukes of thoſe who (whether in a publick or private Capacity) have a call from God to repreſent the evil, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and remedy of Sin, As better than wickedmens either glorying in their own, or flattering of others in their Sins, <hi>ver. 5.</hi> And that becauſe whatever joy or pleaſure ſuch may have in following of, or flattering themſelves, or being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by others in their ſinful Courſes; It is not long-lived, but as a blaze of Thorns, maketh a noiſe and endeth in ſmoak: which woful pleaſure and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering themſelves or others in ſin, he cenſureth as an empty and vain courſe, <hi>ver. 6.

As <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the very firſt and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den motions of Paſſion or Revenge againſt the inſtruments of Trouble, and Perſons of Oppreſſours, which is the habitual and allowed frame of Heart in thoſe who are void of the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>ver. 9.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> From that ſinful quarrelling at the Lords making Times more troubleſome, and Burdens heavier than they have formerly been; ſince this will but argue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the true ſtate of Times, fooliſh preſumption in finding fault with his wiſdom and unbelief of his Soveraignity. <hi>ver. 10.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51442:175"/>
ſo great an hinderance to true Happineſs) from four excellent Effects or Advantages of it, <hi>ver. 11, 12.</hi> As <hi>1.</hi> That it teacheth men by what tenure to hold and by what Rule, &amp; on what occaſions to improve their Worldly Inheritances.

VI.</hi> As a ſixth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt that anxiety and trouble of Spirit, ariſing from the violence of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the great hinderance of Mans true Happineſs; He doth direct to the right Improvement of the Lords Diſpenſations, <hi>ver. 12,</hi> to <hi>21.</hi> Which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to be done <hi>1.</hi> By ſerious Conſideration, and pondering of them, eſpecially ſince what works God brings about contrary to Mans will and deſigns of obtaining Happineſs in them, cannot by Mans wit and power be altered or winded about to ſerve his fancied end of reaching a true Felicity in the Creatures, <hi>ver 13. 2.</hi> By being ſuitably affected with the Lords various Diſpenſations; in Proſperity to rejoyce with Thanksgiving, in Adverſity to conſider ſeriouſly the procuring Cauſes of it; Gods Mind and Ends in it, and our Duty under it: Eſpecially ſince the Lord had ordered ſuch a mixture and ſucceſſion of theſe lots unto Man, That though he had been called to the Council of it, he could not have found out a better and nearer way to advance the Glory of God, and carry on his own Happineſs, than theſe various Diſpenſations, and his own right Improvement of them, <hi>ver. 14. 3.</hi> That ſince in his own ſhort and ſinful Life, he had conſiderable Experience of theſe changes of Diſpenſations, as ordinarily are moſt ſtumbling, ſuch as juſt Men fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before the wicked for Righteouſneſs ſake, and wicked Men proſpering in their ſinful courſes, <hi>ver. 15.</hi> He dehorteth from two Extremities incident to corrupt Nature, upon occaſion of theſe various ways of God. The <hi>One</hi> is, That Men would not affect or arrogate to themſelves ſuch a ſuperlative Righteouſneſs and Wiſdom, as to Cenſure theſe Works of God, as not Wiſely and Equitably carried on, and as if they could manage them to better advantage: And ſo by this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to be more Righteous and Wiſe than God, bring Deſtruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both by inward vexation, when things fall out otherwayes than they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they ſhould; And by outward ſtrokes from a provoked God, for ſuch inſolent Cenſuring of his Diſpenſations, <hi>ver. 16.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is, That upon the wicked, proſpering in his Wickedneſs, they would not diſcover ſo much folly and want of ſaving Knowledge, as to give or ſell themſelves to ſuch a height of Impiety, as ordinarily upon that occaſion unrenewed Men run into.

                  <p>THE main ſcope of the Preacher in this Chapter being to diſcover more of the way to true Happineſs and Contentment, and to point out ſome Remedies of theſe Vexations incident to Men in this Life, That all may be in Love with the Directions he is to give for theſe Ends, he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> commend a <hi>Good Name,</hi> as that which is only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by theſe who walk in the way afterward pointed out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:51442:176"/>And <hi>Next</hi> he commends the <hi>Death</hi> of ſuch as deſirable alſo. This <hi>Good Name</hi> here commended, is not Credit among the Men of the World, which is founded upon outward Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, Riches, Honour, and the like; the Vanity whereof hath been formerly manifeſted, and whereof thoſe that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſt are often deprived: But it is an eſteem with God, founded upon his free Favour; for ſo a good Name is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another Expreſſion in a place parallel to this in this Preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers Writings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. Where loving Favour, which ſignifies the free good Will of God, is put as Exegetick of a good Name: And this carries along with it a deſerved eſteem in the minds of Spiritual Diſcerners, founded upon Gods Grace, evidenced in a Holy Life; ſo that the <hi>Good Name</hi> here commended, is that only which thoſe have who are Chriſtians indeed, or the Anointed ones of the Lord, who are Perfumed with the Graces of his Spirit, appearing in their Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Heavenly Wiſdom, and other Exerciſes after mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And this he commends as better than the moſt <hi>Precious</hi> things in the World, wherein worldly Men ſeek their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which one of the ſweeteſt and moſt uſeful, is here named for the reſt: And ſo in effect he commends Piety by commending the Sign, or temporary reward of it; and that in theſe terms which may be moſt taking with thoſe who are moſt taken up with things worldly; among which Credit, or a <hi>Name</hi> is one of the chief.</p>
                  <p>Next, He commends <hi>The day of Death,</hi> namely the Death of ſuch an one as is thus in eſteem with God, and deſerves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem among men, as far to be preferred to the <hi>Day of ones Birth:</hi> He mentions not the Reaſons of this preference, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Advantages that the Godly have by the one, and the Diſadvantages that all have by the other, to be eaſily condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, ſome whereof are touched in the Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. This Heavenly Policy is neceſſary in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, who would ingage mens Hearts to fall in Love
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51442:177"/>
with the way to true Happineſs, to commend what is to be found in that way, under the Names of theſe things which Carnal men are moſt in Love with: And this may be ſafely done, ſeing what ever it be that any are in Love with, the ſame may be truly found in Fellowſhip with God. If it be Riches men ſeek, in him and his Fellowſhip they may find <hi>Durable Riches</hi> and Righteouſneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18. If Pleaſure, they may <hi>Drink of the River of his Pleaſures,</hi> Pſal. 36.8. And if it be Credit, they may have <hi>A Name better than Oyntment:</hi> For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here commend the way of Holineſs, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the temporary Reward of it, under the name of that which naturally Men moſt affect, <hi>A good Name is better than,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although all that take themſelves to the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may expect Reproach, and Diſgrace for their ſo doing from the profane World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. Yet they may be ſure of a <hi>Name</hi> and Eſteem with God, and with ſuch as are truly Wiſe: For <hi>Solomon</hi> here commends a <hi>Good Name,</hi> as that which all ſhall have who take them to the way pointed out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>A good Name is better than,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although the Godly ſhould die to their worldly Credit, and not haunt after vain Glory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. Yet ſuch a Name, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, even among Men, as is obtained by evidencing the Graces of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2.

                  <p n="4">4. To have ſuch a <hi>Name</hi> or Eſteem with God, and to have his Grace ſo lively in our Hearts, as we may be refreſhful to Others, and fitted for Healing of their Wounds and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is a Caſe more to be prized and ſought after, than the moſt <hi>Precious</hi> things in the World; ſuch a <hi>Name</hi> will never rot, though the Savour of it may be held in for a time, it will ſtill break through the thickeſt cloud of Calumnies and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51442:177"/>
Reproaches: For this comparative way of commending a <hi>good Name</hi> by preferring it to <hi>Precious Oyntment,</hi> imports it to have a reſemblance thereunto, in reſpect of the Fragrancy, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Vertue thereof; and to have ſomething above it, which is mainly the perpetuity of it. <hi>A good Name is better than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Oyntment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>A good Name,</hi> or eſteem among men, is not to be ſought ſo much for what our ſelves have by it, as becauſe it makes us Savoury and Refreſhful to others; and particularly, becauſe it makes us the more fit for healing of their Spiritual Diſtempers, as is imported in <hi>Solomons</hi> preferring it to <hi>Precious Ointment,</hi> which muſt be taken in reference to the proportional effects of both; <hi>A good Name is better than precious Ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Only thoſe have a <hi>Good Name</hi> (deſervedly ſo called) who forſake theſe courſes which the men of this World think their Credit to follow, and who take themſelves to theſe Exerciſes, which others would think a Diſgrace: All others are baſe, and deſervedly eſteemed ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4: For having preſt the undervaluing of theſe things which Worldlings do alone mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, as long Life, Riches and the like: And being to preſs theſe Exerciſes which they undervalue, he commends here a <hi>good Name,</hi> ſuppoſing the ſame to be only attainable by thoſe who forſake the one, and take them to the other, <hi>A good Name is better than precious Ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a greater Sin to blaſt the Reputation of the Godly, and ſo by Slanders and Reproaches to incapacitate them to do farther Service to the Lord, or good to others, than to deſtroy or man the moſt precious things they have in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; for, <hi>A good Name is better than precious Ointment;</hi> which is put for their precious things.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They have not the exerciſe of their Senſes, to whom the fame of the Godly, the good Report of their Heavenly Graces and Vertues, is not ſavoury and refreſhful: They prove themſelves baſe, who delight not to hear their Graces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.

their Vertues praiſed for the praiſe of the Giver, and provoking of others to imitation of them. <hi>For a good Name,</hi> (which may be taken actively, for the Fame, and good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Godly which comes abroad to others) <hi>is better</hi> (or more uſeful for them in a Spiritual ſenſe <hi>than precious Ointment.</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. <hi>The day</hi> of the Godlies <hi>Death,</hi> is in many reſpects preferable to <hi>the day of ones Birth,</hi> whether their own or others: For at the day of their <hi>Death,</hi> their Victory over their Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is compleated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 55.57.

That which worldly Men value moſt, and yet never obtain, that ſame the Godly finds in a more excellent kind, in the way of Holineſs, which the others abhorr; and that which is moſt terrible to the wicked is made ſweet and deſirable to the Godly, for <hi>a Name</hi> is that which Worldlings exceedingly long for, and never get, in the ſenſe wherein it is here commended; And <hi>Death</hi> is that which is moſt terrible to them, and yet the Preacher ſuppoſes here that the Godly have the <hi>Name better than precious Oyntment,</hi> and that their <hi>Death is</hi> ſweet and <hi>better than the day of his Birth.</hi>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having commended <hi>Death,</hi> as preferable to ones <hi>Birth,</hi> he comes now to direct all, how to make timous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Death. And for this end he commends the frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe occaſions, and Societies, where Men are minded of Death, particularly <hi>the Houſe of Mourning,</hi> whereby is meant any place or object that occaſions <hi>Mourning,</hi> eſpecially the houſe where one is Dying, or hath been lately Dead: And where the Friends, or thoſe of near Relation, are ſuppoſed to be left behind ſad hearted; And preferrs the going thither, to the frequenting of ſolemn <hi>Feaſts,</hi> ſuch as uſe to be about the times of <hi>Birth,</hi> or <hi>Marriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he proves the preference by two Reaſons, The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that <hi>Death</hi> whereof Men may be minded by going to the <hi>Houſe of Mourning,</hi> is <hi>the end of all Men,</hi> not of Mens <hi>Being</hi> ſimply, but of their natural temporal Being; And therefore Men ſhould uſe all means to prepare for it. The <hi>Second</hi> is, That the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of ſuch Societies, cannot but in Reaſon make <hi>Living Men,</hi> unleſs they be in a ſpiritual ſenſe, Dead and ſenſeleſs, <hi>lay to their own Hearts,</hi> or take to their ſerious conſideration (as the expreſſion imports) that that will be their own caſe next, to leave others Mourning behind them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. <hi>Mourning</hi> for the Death of Friends is very conſiſtent with true Piety, providing always it be in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mixed with ſubmiſſion to God, and comfort drawn from the Faith of the Reſurrection. 1 <hi>Theſ;</hi> 4.13. Yea it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty thereby to teſtify our natural and Chriſtian Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to our Relations, and ſenſe of our Sin either in Idoliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, neglecting Duty to them, or not making good uſe of them while we had them, which calls the beſt to Mourn, when their Friends are removed by Death. For it is ſuppoſed here, that the Houſe where there is any lately Dead, is <hi>a Houſe of Mourning.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not prejudicial to the true Comfort and Joy of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to be frequently minding Death; nor ſhould he that would have true Chearfulneſs decline the thoughts thereof, as melancholious and prejudicial to his natural health, as Atheiſts and Epicures do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32.33. but ſhould uſe all means to entertain them, as promoving ſpiritual Joy, when the ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Comfort againſt Death is applyed: For <hi>Solomon</hi> who hath preſt frequently the chearful uſe of allowed Comforts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends here the uſe of ſuch means as may keep Men mindful of Death, <hi>It is better to go to the Houſe of mourning.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6 No Man that is wiſe will put off the thoughts of Death, till he be a dying Man, but while he is living and hath Health and Strength, he will lay it to heart and prepare for it: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of minding Death, as a thing ſo equitable and ſutable for Men, that none Living, who hath the uſe of Reaſon can neglect it, and as if he were but a dead Man while he lives, who doth not mind Death ſeriouſly, and prepare for it.</p>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having commended the ſerious Conſideration of Death, he doth now commend that Frame of Spirit, which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:51442:180"/>
the ſanctified conſideration thereof works the Hearts of the Godly unto, as a ſtep nearer to that true Joy and Peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mans Happineſs here doth conſiſt; And this is that ſober, compoſed, and tender temper of Heart, ſtamped with Godly Grief for Sin, here called <hi>Sorrow,</hi> under which alſo may be comprehended moderat Grief, even for worldly Croſſes, which being ſanctified is turned into Godly Sorrow for Sin, This <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is better than Laughter,</hi> whereby he means all that Carnal Mirth and Joy which Men uſe to expreſs by <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or ſuch like light carriage, eſpecially at their Merry meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with others.</p>
                  <p>And that this Sorrow is to be preferred to Carnal Joy, he proves by Reaſons. 1. Becauſe by the ſadneſs of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (whereby he means the grave, humble, and ſober De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of the whole outward Man, which is the Reſult of Godly <hi>Sorrow</hi> within) the Heart is made better, <hi>i. e.</hi> It is wrought to a more mortified Frame, and prepared for ſpiritual Peace; and conſequently the Hearts of others may alſo be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 2. Becauſe it is the diſpoſition of them who are endued with that Saving Wiſdom which is from Above, to have their Hearts much taken up with ſuch Objects, and converſant in ſuch places (whether their Bodies be there or not) as ſerve to increaſe and cheriſh an humble and ſympathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Frame of Spirit: And upon the contrary, <hi>the Fool,</hi> or the wicked Man, who hath ordinarily this Name in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s writings, even when he is reſtrained from the occaſions or places of Carnal Mirth, <hi>His Heart is still in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. When the Lord ſanctifies the thoughts of Death to Men, Godly <hi>Sorrow</hi> will be wrought, or promoved in the Heart, as the Reſult and effect of theſe thoughts, they will grieve, not becauſe they muſt go through Death, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have done the Lord ſo little honour, and are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do him more before they die, and becauſe they find themſelves ſo defective in preparing for Death: For ſuppoſing
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51442:180"/>
this Frame to be the Reſult of theſe Conſiderations, which may be had in the Houſe of Mourning, and by laying Death to Heart, he here commends it, <hi>Sorrow is better than Laughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. However they that are Strangers to Godly Sorrow, eſteem the exerciſe of it comfortleſs and unprofitable. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. yet according to the Truth of God, and the experience of his Saints, it is much to be preferred to the Carnal Mirth of the World, becauſe it makes way for true and ſolid Conſolation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.3. it hath Joy and Peace intermixed with it. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. and always ends in ſpiritual Joy and Praiſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126.5. whereas on the contrary, Carnal Mirth hath always, if the Conſcience be awake, a mixture of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and always ends in heavineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> (ſpeaking doubtleſs his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) at the direction of the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Sorrow is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Laughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The intertaining of a mournful Frame of Spirit for Sin, and ſympathizing with others in Affliction, is a ſpecial mean of attaining to that Happineſs, which is to be had in this Life, and to guard the Heart againſt theſe Vexations which eat up the Spirits of Men: So that Strangers to Godly Sorrow, muſt needs be Strangers to their own Bleſſedneſs: For <hi>Solomon</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome Remedies, of theſe ſinful Diſtempers which more Mens Happineſs, commends this as one, <hi>Sorrow is better than Laughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Godly Sorrow is not a ſudden motion, or flaſh, that evaniſhes, leaving no effect upon the perſon that hath it, but is a Frame that abides, and affects the Heart; So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the outward carriage, and ſo becomes viſible in the effects thereof, which are not a ſullen and auſtere behaviour, or retirement from lawful Society, theſe being rather the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of natural Diſtempers, ſuch as Melancholy, exceſs of worldly Grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than of Godly <hi>Sorrow,</hi> but a ſober Grave modeſt Behaviour, and compoſing of the outward Man: For <hi>Solomon</hi> commending Godly <hi>Sorrow</hi> from the effects thereof,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51442:181"/>
ſuppoſes that it will compoſe the outward Man to a modeſt and ſober Deportment, <hi>By the ſadneſs of the Countenance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That ſoft walking and humble deportment, which flows from Godly Sorrow, or a tender Frame of Spirit within, hath influence back again upon the Heart, to increaſe a good Frame and make it better, it being bleſt with Peace and Comfort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18, 19. and increaſe of every Grace, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. For (ſaith he) <hi>By the ſadneſs of the Countenance the Heart is made better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Levity in the outward Carriage, as it flows often from the want of Humility, and the exerciſe of Godly Sorrow, ſo it makes the Heart much <hi>worſe,</hi> caſting it open to many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, making it more confuſed, leſs peaceable and familiar with God, and ſo more unfit for every Duty: As is imported by the contrary of this, if by the <hi>ſadneſs of the Countenance, the Heart be made better,</hi> than by the <hi>Levity</hi> or Inconſtancy <hi>of the Countenance,</hi> or outward Behaviour, <hi>the Heart is made worſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. As Saving Wiſdom teaches Chriſtians to be Sincere, and not like wicked Hypocrites, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55 21. and to bring their <hi>Hearts</hi> with them, when they go to the <hi>Houſe of Mourning,</hi> to ſignifie their ſympathy with, and deſire to comfort the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there: So when theſe indued with it, are neceſſarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Company of Afflicted Ones, their <hi>Hearts</hi> will be with them, ſympathizing with, and ſupplicating for them; And this even when the Lord's Diſpenſations with themſelves afford them matter of Rejoicing, ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.11. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of this as the ordinary Frame and Temper of the Godly Man, or one indued with the Wiſdom that is from Above, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his own caſe be, and whether he be with the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or not, <hi>The Heart of the Wiſe is in the Houſe of Mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Even when wicked Men may be detained in Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by ſome external Reſtraint, from their ſinful Pleaſures and Companions, as when they are by the Hand of God upon their Body or Spirit, put out of a capacity of taking their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mirth, their Hearts are ſtill with their Idol Carnal Pleaſure,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51442:181"/>
and they are approving of others and counting them Happy who have that Pleaſure: For this doth ſtill agree to a wicked Man ſold to his Carnal Pleaſures, as his ordinary diſpoſition, and that which proves him a <hi>Fool,</hi> void of Saving Knowledge, even though he were in a Priſon, or upon the Bed of Sickneſs, <hi>The Heart of Fools is in the Houſe of Mirth.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

True Wiſdom cannot teach men to evite Injuries and Oppreſſion in the World, but rather the more men have of it, and the Wiſer their Courſes be in order to their true Happineſs, the greater often are their Oppreſſions: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuppoſes here, that the Wiſe man (who according to the Spirits Language in this Book, is the Godly man or the perſon that is indued with ſaving Wiſdom) is often under grievous Oppreſſion, while he ſaith, <hi>Surely Oppreſſion makes a Wiſe Man Mad.</hi>

The <hi>Third</hi> is, That it proves a <hi>Defence</hi> or a <hi>Shadow,</hi> as the Word is, to wit, from many hazards and dangers, eſpecially Spiritual, and this he illuſtrate by aſſerting ſome like Advantage to be had by Riches, <hi>Money</hi>

ſaith he, <hi>is a Defence,</hi> to wit, from outward hazards in ſome caſes: Or this may be taken for a proof of the firſt Advantage, that <hi>Wiſdom is good with an Inheritance,</hi> becauſe he who hath both, hath a double Defence, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> for one, and <hi>Money,</hi> or an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> for another. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Leſt he might ſeem to debaſe this Wiſdom, while he attributes the like effect to it and to Money, he ſhews wherein it excells <hi>The excellency of Knowledge is, that Wiſdom giveth Life</hi> (by which change of the words it appears that they are uſed indifferently in Scripture) whereby is meant, that this <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is the mean of conveying to Men Spiritual, and of leading them to Eternal Life.

The Firſt is, That Men would ſeriouſly <hi>Conſider the work of God.</hi> By the <hi>Work</hi> of God (as is clear by the Inſtances in the following Words) are meant the Diſpenſations of His Providence, carving out <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> or <hi>Adverſity</hi> to Men: The reaſon is, Becauſe Mans Wit, or Power, cannot alter or rectifie what the Wiſe and Irreſiſtable Providence of God brings about, <hi>Who can make straight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which is crooked?</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if there were any crookedneſs, defect, or want of conformfty to the Rule of Equity, in the Lord's Diſpenſations, or in any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that fall out, as they are God's <hi>Work:</hi> But the meaning is, That there are many things in His Diſpenſations croſs, and contrary to Man's will, which ſerve not ſo directly for further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his imaginary Happineſs in this Earth, as he would; ſuch as the oppreſſions formerly ſpoken of, and yet, ſaith he, <hi>They cannot be made ſtraight,</hi> they cannot by Man's Wit or Power be altered, or be made more ſubſervient to his ends, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſerve his ſerious conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Next</hi> Direction is inferred upon this Reaſon; That Men would ſtudy to be ſutably affected to the Lord's various Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, which he inſtances in Two, <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity,</hi> comprehending all others, and ſhews the prime exerciſes which theſe Diſpenſations call Men unto, <hi>In Proſperity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be joyful,</hi> he means Spiritual Chearfulneſs, and Thankfulneſs to God, when things go well; And <hi>In Adverſity,</hi> he doth not
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51442:189"/>
preſs that which it contrary to Joy, but that which Men are often then moſt indiſpoſed for, namely the ſerious <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the Lord's Mind, and what uſe they ought to make of that caſe, and the Reaſon of this is, that God hath ſo wiſely <hi>interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe Two,</hi> and made them <hi>to ſucceed</hi> one to another in the Life of Man, that <hi>he ſhall not find</hi> out any nearer way to his own Happineſs, than by behaving himſelf ſutably to, and making that uſe of theſe Diſpenſations, which God in His Word requires of him, <hi>he ſhall find nothing,</hi> which if his counſel had been taken, might have been better done; nor can he in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon imagine, that any thing would be more conducible for God's Glory, and Man's Happineſs, than the Diſpenſations of God, as they are ordered by Him; and therefore he ſhould ſubmit unto, and carry himſelf as God requires, under them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. There is not any <hi>Work</hi> of God's Providence in the World, which doth not deſerve Mans moſt ſerious thoughts to be taken up with it, every one of them having many of the divine Properties ingraven upon them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 111.2, 3. and ſome language to us concerning the Lord's Mind and our duty, <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.9. and our blindneſs being ſuch, that we cannot at the firſt view take up that which may be ſeen in any of the <hi>Works</hi> of God, till after pondering every part, and comparing one with another, and all with the Word commenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, we may ſee what the Lord intends thereby, and what is our duty in reference thereunto: For this is it <hi>Solomon</hi> here preſſes, <hi>Conſider the Work of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that would ſo <hi>conſider the Works</hi> of Providence, as to work their Hearts to quietneſs, and guard them againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and Diſcontent, muſt look above Creatures, ſecond Cauſes and Inſtruments, and conſider all Events as <hi>God's Work,</hi> and all Diſpenſations though produced by various Inſtruments, and in different Periods of time, as one whole and intire <hi>Work</hi> in God's Hand, if we look upon croſs Diſpenſations as the work of Inſtruments only, our paſſion ariſes againſt them, and we
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51442:189"/>
fret and become diſcouraged: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> giving a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Vexation, preſcribes to Men the lerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the various Diſpenſations of God in Proſperity and Adverſity, inſtanced afterward as one Work, and the ſame as the <hi>Work of God, Conſider the Work of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is ſuch infinit Wiſdom manifeſted in all the Works of God's Providence, whether of Juſtice or Mercy, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104.24. and ſuch irreſiſtible power doth accompany them all, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining His Holy Ends in them <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13, that it is ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the wit or power of Creatures, to rectify or change in the leaſt what he doth. If he croſs Mens Interpriſes by Sea or Land, it is a folly for them to think by themſelves to repair their loſs; If He break the Legs and Arms of States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and make them halt, all the Earth without Him, cannot make them go <hi>Straight</hi> again; If He leave any to the Crookedneſs or Perverſity of their own Nature (for He may be ſaid to <hi>make Crooked,</hi> as He is ſaid to <hi>Harden</hi> Mens Hearts) neither Angels nor Men can rectify the ſame. The conſideration whereof ſerves to quiet our Hearts, and make us ſubmiſſive to His Working: For to theſe, and many other things of that ſort, may this be applyed, as a Reaſon to make Men ſubmiſſive to His Working, <hi>Who can make Straight that which he hath made crooked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though there be no caſe of a Child of God ſo ſad, wherein he hath not matter of Rejoicing, and ought to make conſcience thereof, <hi>Hab.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. yet when the Lord manifeſt himſelf in ſome ſpecial way favourable in His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, giving him the deſired ſucceſs of His lawful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and ſatisfaction to His juſt Deſires, he is then in a ſpecial manner called to Spiritual Joy and Praiſe, and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the ſame by a cheerful Walking before the Lord: For this is here preſt upon the Godly in a proſperous condition, <hi>In the day of Proſperity be joyful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The main Exerciſe which God's People are called to under ſad Diſpenſations, is, The ſerious conſideration of Gods

working, that they may know from the Word what may be the ſinful procuring cauſes upon their parts, of ſuch ſad things, and ſo may be humbled for them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. what are the good Ends which God aims at in dealing ſo with them, that they may aim at the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16, and what hazard they are in, to put forth their Hands to Iniquity in ſuch a caſe, that they may Watch and Pray. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 125.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.41. For <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> after he hath preſt the <hi>Conſideration of the Work of God</hi> in general in the former Verſe, doth here particularly apply the Exhortation to Men under ſad Diſpenſations, <hi>In the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity conſider,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Even the beſt, while they are proſperous, are ſo little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Adverſity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. That readily when it comes, they are ſo aſtoniſhed, that they can hardly command any diſtinct thoughts of their own caſe, or of Gods Mind in His dealing with them, therefore they have need to be thus put to it, as to a difficult work, <hi>In the day of Adverſity conſider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. As the Godly may have much matter of Joy (which they think not of) under very ſad Diſpenſations, ſo they are then prone to run upon the ſinful extream of Diſcouragement, and Deſpondency of Spirit: For having exhorted them to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the day of <hi>Proſperity,</hi> he doth not preſs them to Mourn in the contrary caſe, But <hi>in the day of Adverſity conſider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Lord hath <hi>interwoven Proſperity and Adverſity</hi> along the Lives of his People, and makes the one of theſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>Suceeed</hi> to the other, knowing that they are ready in the day of <hi>Proſperity</hi> to be lifted up above meaſure, if ſome Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be not ſet in the Ballance <hi>Againſt it,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.

that no man can find out any thing wanting in the contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe, which might more conduce for Gods Glory, and his Peoples Happineſs; ſo that if any man think it had been better that <hi>Proſperity</hi> had come ſooner, or continued longer, or that <hi>Adverſity</hi> had either not come at all, or come later, or continued ſhorter, he proves himſelf a <hi>Fool</hi> in making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Wiſer than God: For he hath wiſely ordered his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to the end, <hi>that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi>

                     <hi>Next,</hi> He giveth two inſtances of theſe Diſpenſations which he had obſerved, and which Men are moſt apt to ſtumble at. The one is, of a <hi>Juſt Man periſhing in his Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if any juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, and walking Holily (who is the Righteous One here ſpoken of) could totally and finally Periſh or be Loſt, but the meaning is, that ſuch an One may ſuffer the loſs of his natural Life, and outward Eſtate, and fall under common Calamities, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51442:191"/>
that <hi>For</hi> his Righteouſneſs, as the particle <hi>IN</hi> is ſometimes uſed to ſignify in Scripture <hi>Math.</hi> 6.7. The other inſtance is of a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> ſpared and injoying <hi>a long Life in Wickedneſs,</hi> ver. 15</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> he diſſwades from ſome of theſe Evils which readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtir in corrupt nature, upon the obſervation of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and they are of two ſorts. 1. Either Men cenſure theſe Diſpenſations of the Lord in ſuffering the <hi>Righteous to Periſh,</hi> and the <hi>days of the Wicked to be prolonged,</hi> as if this Government of things were not Righteouſly and Wiſely carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as if themſelves would deal more equitably and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by giving temporal reward and puniſhment, to the Godly and Wicked according to their way: Now this is to be <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over much,</hi> and to be <hi>Over-wiſe.</hi> And ſo theſe expreſſions are not to be underſtood, as if there could be any exceſs of true Righteouſneſs, or ſaving Wiſdom, but that there is a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and affected Righteouſneſs and Wiſdom that Men arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themſelves, while they cenſure Divine Diſpenſations, and imagine they would diſpoſe more Wiſely of things: And this he diſſwades from by an Argument taken from the hazard of it, <hi>why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf,</hi> both by inward Vexation that things ſhould go ſo contrary to what thou thinkeſt would be right and wiſely done, and ſo alſo by provoking God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict deſtroying ſtroaks <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Or 2. If Men run not upon this ſinful extream, then readily upon the ſight of the Wickeds Proſpering, and prolonging his Life in his Wickedneſs, they looſe the Reines to all ſort of iniquity; and from this he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades, while he ſaith, <hi>Be not over much wicked, neither be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Fooliſh,</hi> which cannot be underſtood as if any degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs were approven or tolerat by him, who perfectly hates all Iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. But the meaning is, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware to give themſelves up to that height of Wickedneſs (and ſo to manifeſt themſelves deſtitut of Saving Knowledge) which readily unrenewed Men run unto, upon the ſight of Wicked Mens proſpering in ſin for a time: And this alſo he preſſes by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51442:191"/>
a Reaſon much of the ſame force with the former, <hi>why ſhouldest thou Die before thy time?</hi> Not as if the Death of any could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the time which God hath appointed, but the meaning is, that Men by their carriage do what in them lyes to ſhorten their Days, and haſten their own Death by their Sinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>before the time,</hi> to which according to the ordinary courſe of nature, they might have come.</p>
                  <p>From this Purpoſe Learn 1. That which doth much marr ſubmiſſion to the Lord's Diſpenſations is, that Men look upon them as ſtrange and not uſual, as if thoſe who lived before had not ſeen the like: For as a Remedy of want of ſubmiſſion to the Lord's Diſpenſations, <hi>Solomon</hi> here holds forth his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Obſervation of the like, <hi>All things have I ſeen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whenſoever Men reflect aright upon their by paſt time, how proſperous or peaceable ſoever it hath been, they will ſee it <hi>Vain,</hi> not only for the ſhortneſs of it, which is beſt ſeen when it is paſt, and for the mixture of Croſſes that hath been with it, but mainly for that ſinfulneſs which hath accompanied them in their beſt times: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here deſcribe his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt time. <hi>The days of my Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though all that are juſtified by the imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and are truely Holy, be beyond the hazard of eternal periſhing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. yet ſuch is the malice of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World againſt theſe whoſe carriage is a tacite Reproof and Shame to theirs, that they are often cut off in the way of Wel-doing, and ſo periſh in regard of their natural Life and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſts, which is a merciful Diſpenſation to them, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their eternal Reſt and Felicity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. For, (ſaith <hi>Solomon) There is a just Man that periſheth in his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51442:192"/>
them, and to ſpare them long in their ſinful Courſes, that at laſt the equity of His ſeverity againſt them, may be the more conſpicuous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is a wicked Man that prolongs his life in his wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though the beſt of Men come far ſhort of conformity to the Rule of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and of that meaſure of heavenly Wiſdom which is attainable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. yet there is ſo much Pride and Arrogancy in Men, that they fancy themſelves to have, or preſume to attain unto, a more exact Righteouſneſs, and higher degree of Wiſdom, than God doth require or approve, while they affect a Righteouſneſs of their own, before they come to Chriſt to get it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.8. while they think to pleaſe God with more ſevere Exerciſes of Religion, or with greater Pains or Coſt in His Worſhip, than He requires, <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.6, 7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and eſpecially, which is mainly intended here, while they cenſure the Lord's Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in ſuffering the Juſt to periſh in his Righteouſneſs; as if they would have a more exact Righteouſneſs in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Affairs in the World; and think it were greater wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to cut off the Wicked, than to ſuffer them to prolong their days in wickedneſs: For this is here diſſwaded from, <hi>Be not Righteous over much, neither make thy ſelf over Wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. This bold preſumption of Men in magnifying their own worth and wiſdom, as if they could guide the World more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and wiſely than God doth, deſerves to be ſuppreſſed with Holy Scorn and Indignation: For we may look upon this as an Holy Irony, <hi>Be not Righteous over much, neither make thy ſelf over Wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. To cenſure the Lords Diſpenſations, as if there ought to be more Equity and Wiſdom manifeſted in them, is the neereſt way for Men to draw deſtruction upon themſelves, not only in ſo far as by their anxiety, and fretting againſt what cannot be changed, they ſpend their own Spirits, but mainly, becauſe it is a Sin crying for Deſtruction from the Almighty, and will
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:51442:192"/>
draw it out of His Hand, if it be continued in, as is imported in this Reaſon, <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is Mens conceit of their own Wiſdom, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the height of folly, that makes them miſs any degree of Righteouſneſs, and Equity in the Lords proceedings: For this laſt Branch of the Diſſwaſive may be looked upon as the cauſe of the former, <hi>Be not Righteous over much,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a more equitable way than God keeps in His dealing, <hi>Neither be thou over Wiſe,</hi> namely in thine own eyes, which occaſions the former.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. From the ſight of Piety oppreſſed, and Wickedneſs ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in proſpering, there doth ariſe in Mens corrupt Nature a powerful temptation to looſe the Reines to all Impiety, when Men ſee Wickedneſs rewarded, and them that tempt God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, they are ready to run with ſuch to the ſame exceſs of Riot, and do Evil with <hi>both hands</hi> earneſtly, which is the thing here diſſwaded from, <hi>Be not over much wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. To take liberty and incouragement to commit Iniquity with greedineſs, from the impunity of others committing the like, is great <hi>Folly,</hi> and an evidence, of the want of the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge of God: And this Ignorance or Folly is alſo the cauſe of their giving up themſelves to that courſe: For this ſecond Clauſe may be looked upon both as the evidence, and cauſe of the former, <hi>Neither be thou fooliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11.

                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, that he had with full purpoſe of Heart given up himſelf to acquire that Experimental Knowledge which here he Communicats to Others, he ſaid, <hi>He would be Wiſe.</hi> And withall no humbly reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of this he gives two Reaſons. 1. That Gods providence in Governing the World, is a ſubject very far remote from common Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and in it ſelf Myſterious and profound; And this he ſets forth by two Similitudes; the one is of things <hi>Far</hi> diſtant from us, as it were at the remoteſt Corners of the Earth, which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:51442:197"/>
we can not ſee, nor without difficulty hear or know any thing of: The other is of things <hi>Deep,</hi> down in the bottom of the Sea (as it were) or at the center of the Earth, for the word <hi>Deep</hi> is doubled in the Original, and is well Tranſlated <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deep</hi> ver. 24. And that it may not be thought his Lazineſs was the cauſe of his ſhort Sightedneſs, he ſhews that his heart was wholly bent upon that ſtudy, and that he did multiply his indeavours in the uſe of all lawful means, as the different expreſſions here of <hi>Applying</hi> his <hi>Heart, Searching,</hi> and <hi>Seeking out</hi> import, as they do elſewhere in Scripture <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He ſhews what it was that he did particularly aim at in his Study. 1. To <hi>Know Wiſdom,</hi> which is nothing elſe, according to the ſcope, but to underſtand the Mind of God in his Diſpenſations, ſo far as the ſame may be known by the light of the Word and Spirit of God: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.9. And 2. <hi>To know the reaſon of things,</hi> whereby is meant not ſo much the knowledge of the natural Cauſes of things, as of the Bleſſed Ends and Holy Reaſons, which God hath in His Operations. And 3. To <hi>know the wickedneſs of Folly,</hi> whereby he means the exceeding ſinfulneſs of every Courſe that a natural Man can take for his Happineſs, according to the Apoſtles Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. eſpecially Mens giving themſelves up to their ſenſual Pleaſures, wherein they are moſt mad, as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words make evident. All which may make the Light held forth by him very acceptable.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. As it is the Commendation of a Preacher of the Truth, that he ſpeak from <hi>Experience,</hi> eſpecially when he commends the way of God, having put the matter to the proof himſelf, and found all that he ſpeaks verified: So this ſhould commend the Truth to the People, and add weight to it, when beſide the Evidence and Authority of it in it ſelf, they hear it commended by thoſe, whom they may in Charity judge to have taſted the Sweetneſs of it, and do therefore ſpeak becauſe they believe: For <hi>Solomon</hi> having commended heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51442:198"/>
Wiſdom that it brings <hi>Life</hi> ver. 12. and <hi>Strength</hi> ver. 19. to them that are indued with it, he here commends it from his own Experience, <hi>All this have I proved by wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe whom the Lord hath indued with the greateſt meaſure of Saving Knowledge, and upon whom He minds to beſtow yet a greater meaſure thereof. He uſes to give to thoſe, ſtrong deſires after more and more of it, and a reſolute purpoſe to purſue it in the uſe of all lawful means: For <hi>Solomon</hi> who had great Wiſdom, and thereby acquired Experience, lays down a fixed Reſolution to have yet more, <hi>All this have I proved by wiſdom, I ſaid I will be Wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe who have the greateſt meaſure of Knowledge, and whoſe deſires after more are ſtrongeſt, will ſtill be ſhort of what may be attained, and the farther they promove they will ſtill be the more humble, and ſenſible of their ſhort coming; they that know leaſt do often think they know moſt, and do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine more than their own meaſure, needleſs: For even <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> doth here humbly regrate his ſhort coming, <hi>But it was far from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is ſuch a great depth of Wiſdom in all the works of God, eſpecially in His works of Providence, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſhallow witt of Man to attain to a fully clear, or ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight thereof; the ſharpeſt ſighted will find himſelf in the dark, and therefore muſt adore and reverence what he cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend, perſwading himſelf, that that is wiſely done, whereof he ſees not always a ſatisfactory Reaſon; and ſhould look upon that which may be learned farther of every work of Providence (in reference to his own natural ability to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it) as a Pearl lying at the bottom of the Sea, or ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Commodity, at the fartheſt part of the Earth. <hi>That which is far off, and exceeding deep who can find it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Neither the profound myſteriouſneſs of Gods <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in His Diſpenſations, nor the weakneſs of our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſhould diſcourage the Students of that <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> who would

be wiſe unto Salvation, but ſhould ſo much the more ſharpen their deſires, and quicken their endeavours, after a farther meaſure of Knowledge, ſeing there is a growing ſucceſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſuch. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. For ſo was it with <hi>Solomon,</hi> though he <hi>found Wiſdom far off,</hi> and <hi>exceeding deep;</hi> yet (ſaith he) <hi>I applied my Heart to know, and to ſearch, and to ſeek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They that would be Proficients in true Knowledge, muſt apply their Hearts to that ſtudy, they muſt carry a preſent compoſed mind always about with them, and be buſie in obſerving what may be known of God, that may draw their Affections to Him, and engage them to His Service, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſappointment of deſired ſucceſs, and darkneſs remaining, muſt renew their endeavours in the uſe of one commanded mean after another: For ſo was it with <hi>Solomon,</hi> I <hi>applied my Heart</hi> (or as the Original may be rendred, <hi>I and my Heart went about together</hi>) to <hi>ſearch and ſeek out Wiſdom,</hi> what he could not find out by <hi>Searching,</hi> he <hi>ſought out,</hi> which is one endeavour after another.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 They that would judge aright of the Lord's Diſpenſations, muſt labour to ſee by the light of the Word and Spirit, what Reaſons there may be for them: As for Example, why the Lord ſuffers His people to be brought ſo low in the World; even that He may humble them and prove them; and do them good in the latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. And why He ſuffers wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men to proſper, even that if they will not by His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be led to Repentance, they may be the riper for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92.7 that ſo we may ſatisfie our own minds, and be able to give a Reaſon to others of what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to know: For this was one thing that <hi>Solomon</hi> made his ſtudy, <hi>To know the reaſon of things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 That which is truly good is more clearly ſeen when we conſider the evil that is contrary to it: The <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and excellency of Saving Knowledge is illuſtrat, and beſt ſeen, when the deformity of Sin, the madneſs and unreaſonableneſs
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51442:199"/>
of theſe Courſes which natural Men take to come at their imaginary Happineſs, are compared therewith: For <hi>Solomon</hi> took this way, <hi>He gave his Heart to know Wiſdom, and to know the wickedneſs of Folly, even of Fooliſhneſs and Madneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. As every Man who is not indued with Saving <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is deſperat in <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and extremely <hi>Mad</hi> in following the courſe that will be his ruine: So there is ſuch a height of wickedneſs, and perverſity in his way, that it is not eaſy to expreſs the ſame: For <hi>Solomon</hi> multiplies words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as if it had been difficult for him to expreſs it, while he calls it, The <hi>wickedneſs of Folly, even of Fooliſhneſs and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p>THis Wiſe Man having regrated the imperfection of his Knowledge, notwithſtanding of his moſt ſerious inquiry after it, formerly mentioned, he doth here and in the following words give inſtances of ſome ſucceſs he had of his pains.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, concerning the Evil of ſinful Pleaſures, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the ſatisfying of the Luſts of the Fleſh: And in ſetting forth this, he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> deſcribe a Whoriſh Woman from two things: The 1. is, That <hi>her Heart is Snares and Nets,</hi> the meaning whereof is, That her <hi>Heart</hi> being under the power of her Luſts, doth catch every Temptation to that Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:51442:199"/>
which is explained by that Expreſſion <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.6. <hi>The Heart gathers iniquity to it ſelf;</hi> And likeways that her Heart is full of ſubtile Plots and Inſinuations to inſnare Men, and draw them to her deſires, as Fowlers and Fiſhers have their Nets and Baits, to entangle Birds and Fiſhes, which are the Metaphores in the Words. 2. That <hi>her Hands are as Bands;</hi> whereby are meant her powerful Stratagems to hold Men faſt Slaves to her, and their own Luſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He giveth ſome Arguments to deterr the Hearts of all from being entangled with Temptations of this ſort. 1. That he himſelf had found in his own experience, and did in part yet feel the bitterneſs of giving way to that Sin of Impurity, which is ſo <hi>Bitter</hi> that Temporal <hi>Death</hi> is to be preferred to the baſe Slavery of it: By which it ſeems very clear, not only that <hi>Solomon</hi> was a true Penitent, but that this Book hath been written after, and in teſtimony of his Repentance, ſeing at the writting hereof his Uncleanneſs was <hi>ſo bitter</hi> to him, that he cannot expreſs it, but by calling it <hi>more grievous than Death</hi> it ſelf, to wit, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death, which only deprives Men of their Natural Life, and the Comforts of it, but theſe ſinful Pleaſures deprive them of Spiritual Life, and the Comforts of Communion with God. 2. That the Man who is <hi>Favoured of God</hi> in a ſpecial way, ſhall <hi>eſcape</hi> ſuch Temptations, that is, either he ſhall not be entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them, or ſhall be mercifully reſcued from them, and conſequently as himſelf expreſſes this ſame purpoſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22 14. they muſt be <hi>Abhorred of God</hi> who are given up to them. 3. That this Sin of Uncleanneſs is often the puniſhment of other Sins, <hi>The Sinner</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be taken by her:</hi> By the <hi>Sinner</hi> is not meant every one that deſerves that Name, for then all ſhould be taken: but by the <hi>Sinner</hi> (as is uſual in Scripture when that Name is oppoſed to the Godly, or the upright Perſon) is meant, One <hi>given up, or giving himſelf up to Sin,</hi> and making a Trade of living in it, ſuch a Man is juſtly left to fall into this moſt bitter, and abominable Sin of Uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:51442:200"/>Hence Learn 1. Whatever diſſatisfaction ſincere Students of Saving Knowledge, may have with their meaſure, they ſhall be ſure to find ſucceſs in that which tends moſt to their true Happineſs, and to the preventing of their Eternal Ruine: For <hi>Solomon</hi> having regrated his ſhort-coming in the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> before, cannot but acknowledge that he was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſuccesful, <hi>And I find more bitter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To feel experimentally the bitterneſs of Sin,</hi> and to have a lively repreſentation of the hazard of living in it, is not the leaſt part of the ſucceſs of Mens pains for Saving Knowledge: For without this they can know nothing Savingly: Therefore this is one Inſtance which <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth as a Bleſſed Fruit of his pains, that he found ſinful Pleaſures, <hi>More bitter than Death:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. However Sinners apprehend much pleaſure in Sin, when they commit it; yet there is a woful Sting afterward, and much <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> in the latter end of it, every Penitent finds it in mercy ſo <hi>Bitter</hi> to him when his Conſcience is wakened, that he would rather venture upon Temporal <hi>Death,</hi> than enjoy his ſinful Pleaſures again: And impenitent Sinners find it ſo in Wrath here ſometimes, by the Stings of an accuſing Conſcience, eſpecially while Poverty, Diſgrace, and loathſome Diſeaſes making their Lives <hi>Bitter,</hi> are upon them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.11. and always at Death, and after it to Eternity, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. &amp;c. So that all that ever took pleaſure in Sin, ſhall be forced to ſpeak this Language one time or other, <hi>I find it more bitter than Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Sinners are left to the power of their Luſts, they are very ſtudious to enſnare others, thoſe that are weakeſt before Temptations, are often ſtrongeſt to enſnare, and hold others faſt in the Snare with them, and they are plagued with <hi>ſubtility</hi> of Wit for that end: For <hi>the whoriſh Womans Heart and Hand</hi> go together, <hi>her Heart is Snares and Nets, and her Hands Bands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the Temptations to the Sin of Uncleannſs, eſpecially from laſcivious and light <hi>Women,</hi> are <hi>ſubtile</hi> and not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; ſo when Men are once entangled in that Sin, they are
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51442:200"/>
often made abſolute Slaves to it, and held faſt in it, it is not an eaſie matter to reclaim any ſuch, only God's Wiſdom muſt diſcover the <hi>Net and the Snare,</hi> and His Power muſt looſe the <hi>Bands:</hi> For as <hi>her Heart is Snares and Nets,</hi> which are ſet ſo as they are not ſeen, ſo <hi>her Hands are as Bands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Men intangled with the pleaſures of Sin, eſpecially the baſe Bewitching inticements of Whoriſh <hi>Women,</hi> could look right upon their own caſe, they would ſee themſelves like ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Birds or Fiſhes deprived of their true liberty, and Caught in the Devils <hi>Net</hi> to be preyed upon, but ſuch Slaves think their Bondage, Liberty: For <hi>her heart is Snares and Nets, and her hands Bands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. As it is a great ſign of Gods ſpecial Favour and delight in a perſon to be kept from ſinful Snares, or to be liberat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are intangled with them, ſo the beſt way to be kept free of them, or to eſcape from them, is to make the pleaſure of God our Pleaſure: So ſhould Men find as much true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Gods Service and Communion with him, as would make ſinful pleaſures loathſome to them; For ſaith he, <hi>whoſe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God</hi> (the Words ſignifie either one <hi>Favoured</hi> by and pleaſing to God, or one that <hi>ſtudies to pleaſe him) ſhall eſcape from her.</hi>

                  <p>And to make his Teſtimony in this have the more weight and credit. He 1. calls all to conſider it as experimentally known to himſelf. 2.

once inſlaved with them, that few or none of them eſcape, in compariſon of thoſe who remain Slaves till they Periſh; they muſt go thorow many inſtances to ſee this Truth verified: For ſo did <hi>Solomon</hi> here <hi>counting One by One</hi> to find out the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True Penitents are very deſirous to ſee other Sinners, eſpecially thoſe who have been their Companions in Sin, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and powerfully reclaimed, becauſe they exceedingly thirſt that the ſame Grace which pardoned, and reclaimed them, may be Glorious in the ſame effects toward others: For <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> who was a Penitent. <hi>And One man among a Thouſand himſelf,</hi> ſaith (while he wrote this) <hi>that he was yet ſeeking to find out</hi> ſome farther inſtances of this nature, <hi>Which yet my Soul ſeeketh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though there be not wanting rare examples recordeed in Scripture of the power and freedom of Gods Rich Grace in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming ſome of the vileſt of Sinners, and of thoſe a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number if they be conſidered in themſelves, yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them comparatively with the great number of thoſe who being once intangled, eſpecially with Temptations pleaſant to the Fleſh, are never reclaimed, but periſh in their Sins, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is but <hi>very few,</hi> and as it were <hi>One among a Thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> For this is it the Preacher ſaith, <hi>he found One</hi> (and but One) <hi>Man among a Thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of all Sinners in the world thoſe who have been moſt active to draw others to the ſame Sin with themſelves, and have been moſt ſuccesful that way, are moſt hardly reclaimed, and the examples of ſuch are rareſt (though ſome ſuch there be <hi>Act.</hi> 26, 11) For it is of ſuch <hi>Women</hi> whoſe <hi>Hearts are Nets and Snares and their Hands Bonds,</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks (and certainly the truth holds no leſs as to ſuch Men alſo) while he ſaith <hi>a Woman among all thoſe have I not found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. That which is moſt difficult in it ſelf, and therefore moſt rare, is very eaſy, and ordinary to Gods free and powerful Grace, when he pleaſes to manifeſt it: For, he who is greater

than <hi>Solomon,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, gave proofs of his power and Mercy in reclaiming ſuch Harlots as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. &amp;c. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> having Counted One by One <hi>could not find One of a Thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. A Sinner may attain to Repentance, and confidence of Mercy, though he know no ſuch rare Monument of Mercy as himſelf, nor <hi>One of a Thouſand</hi> involved in the ſame guilt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, truly Penitent: <hi>Paul</hi> knew not his match, nor <hi>Solomon</hi> his, and yet both were Penitent Believers, <hi>One Man among a Thouſand have I found,</hi> it is probable he means himſelf, but a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among all thoſe (that is of ſuch a number) <hi>have I not found,</hi> it is probable he means the Thouſand that inticed him to Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is not Wiſdom for any to conclude, that there are none reclaimed or Penitent, even among the greateſt Sinners in the World, though they cannot after moſt ſerious Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them and their caſe, conclude any of them ſuch, or ſee evidences thereof in them, there may be <hi>Seven Thouſand</hi> where the ſharpeſt ſighted cannot ſee <hi>One of a Thouſand.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18.

                  <p>The firſt is that <hi>God made Man upright,</hi> this is the ſame with the expreſſion of <hi>making Man according to the Image of God,</hi> or as the word here ſignifies, <hi>Straight,</hi> that is, conform to the will of God, and indued with Original Righteouſneſs; So that
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51442:203"/>
his Majeſty is free of all the Sin and Miſery that is come upon Man: And while he ſaith <hi>he found this only,</hi> to wit, this which he Branches out here in two Concluſions, it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>as if he had found no other thing by</hi> his inquiry formerly mentioned, for he ſets down ſeveral things he had found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; But the meaning is, that theſe two ſerving moſt to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God, and humble Man as the cauſe of his own Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, were the moſt ſatisfying conſiderations; Or <hi>this only he found</hi> farther (beſide what is formerly expreſt) fit to be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate as the reſult of his pains for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ver. 25. Neither is this to be underſtood as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had now firſt of all found out theſe Truths here expreſt, ſeing they are plainly revealed by <hi>Moſes</hi> Gen. 5.1. And 6.5. And ſurely he was trained up in the Knowledge of them, but that he had gotten a new ſight of them, and had read them of new upon the Lords Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Man, and the bad meeting which Man gives to God.</p>
                  <p>The Second Concluſion is <hi>They have ſought out many Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the meaning whereof is, that <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity can do nothing now but deviſe and multiply <hi>Curious Artificial ways,</hi> as the word <hi>Inventions</hi> ſignifies for diſhonouring God, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Miſerable: Now he changes the perſon here having ſpoken of <hi>Man</hi> in the ſingular number, he now ſpeaks of <hi>All Men</hi> in the Plural, whereof three Reaſons may be given. 1. Becauſe he would Caution what he ſpoke in the former Verſe, leſt any might think there were ſome degree of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perverſity, peculiar to the one Sexe, which the other hath not, therefore he charges this equally upon the whole Poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi> 2.

                     </gap> Becauſe all that are come of him, are but parts of him, and ſo, in the former part of the verſe, he ſpeaks of mankind in the Root, and that in Integrity, here he ſpeakes of the ſame both in the Root and Branches, as fallen and corrupt.</p>

                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:51442:203"/>Hence Learn. 1. Theſe Truths which are plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word, and which we have Learned from it before, we ſhould labour to find them out by our own Experience and Obſervation, as written and to be read upon the Lords Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations with Men, and their carriage toward him; when they are ſo found out they become very ſweet, they have a new Reliſh, and ſatisfaction to the Soul: For <hi>Solomon</hi> who probably, read theſe ſame things in the Scriptures formerly cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, concerning Mans primitive Integrity and Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wherein he was created, and concerning his fall, and corrupting of himſelf, doth here ſpeak of them as found out by him, upon that diligent ſearch of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and of <hi>the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Folly and Madneſs,</hi> formerly mentioned, <hi>This only have I found, That God made Man upright, but They have ſought out many Inventions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that ſeriouſly conſider Gods Wiſdom in the courſe of his Providence, and the perverſe and mad Courſes that Men follow, will from the one find that God is to be juſtified as free of Mans Sin and Miſery, and ſo may be helped to aſſent to this Truth revealed in the Word, <hi>that God made Man upright</hi> at the firſt, ſeing they will find him incouraging Men to wel-doing, and frequently teſtifying his diſpleaſure againſt their Impiety. And from the other they may read, that Men only are to be blamed for all the Sin and Miſery that is come upon them, while they may be obſerved ordinarily Sinning againſt their light, and the checks of their Conſcience, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting much good which is in their power to do: For theſe two are here expreſt as Obſervations which <hi>Solomon</hi> made upon Gods wiſe way with Men, and Mens perverſe way before the Lord, <hi>This only have I found, that God made Man upright, but They have ſought out many Inventions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which we ſhould mainly aim at in our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lords Diſpenſations, and Mens carriage before him, is to find cauſe of juſtifying and exalting God, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

and debaſing Man: For ſaith <hi>Solomon, this Only, or Mainly have I found, That God made Man upright, but They have ſought out many Inventions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Man came firſt from the hand of him that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, there was no deformity in him, he was made <hi>Straight</hi> (as the word <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> ſignifies) not only as to the ſtructure of his Body, whereby he excels other Creatures, and ſhould be taught to mind things Heavenly, and not to ly groveling like a beaſt upon the Earth, in ſenſual Pleaſures common to him with the beaſt, but mainly in reſpect of the conſtitution of his Soul, he was <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> his mind or thoughts and conceptions being clear, and his will and affections conform to the will of his Maker. The Lord hath done nothing ſince to deface that frame, Satan and Mens Corruption have done all that, ſo that God is free of all that ruine that is come upon Man: For <hi>God made Man upright.</hi>

The <hi>Firſt</hi> is taken from his own obſervation, of the Miſery of ſome that have been highly advanced in the World, while by the abuſe of their power, they not only prejudge others, but often brings Temporal, and always (if not by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prevented) Eternal Wrath upon themſelves. <hi>ver. 9. II.</hi> He evidenceth
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:51442:205"/>
this, That notwithſtanding the high advancement of ſuch Men, in their frequenting the places of, and concernment in publick Judicatories, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship; yet they should be buried and put under the Earth, wherein they placed their Happineſs, and their Memories which they deſigned to perpetual after Death, shall be forgotten among Men. <hi>ver. 10.</hi> Which he amplifies, by giving the Reaſon why ſuch Men are ſo bent upon their ſinful Courſes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ways, namely becauſe the declared Threatnings in Scripture are not preſently after their committing Sin put to execution againſt them. <hi>ver. 11. III.</hi> That he may farther shew the Vanity of worldly Greatneſs without Saving Knowledge, and that ſinful Courſes are not ſure ways to preſerve from Evil, and to guard the Hearts of Saints from ſtumbling at ſuch Mens Greatneſs, and encourage them under their Oppreſſions by them, he publisheth to the terrour of all ſuch wicked Men, eſpecially oppreſſing Rulers, That notwithſtanding their fancying that by their long Life, affluence of outward Comforts, and their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied Tranſgreſſions, they should eſcape the Judgement of God. <hi>ver. 12.</hi> Yet (tho he certainly concludeth the Welfare of them that ſincerely Fear God, and His Goodneſs, for which wicked Men did perſecute and oppreſs them. <hi>ver. 12.</hi>) he in a powerful and pathetick way, denounceth Wrath againſt them, both in general, That it shall not be well with them (where more is meaned than expreſſed) and in particular, That tho' he may have a long Life compared with others, yet shall he not prolong his days, either to that length he deſired, or to an Eternity of Happineſs, <hi>ver. 13.</hi> Which he amplifies <hi>Firſt,</hi> By a deſcription of the Life of ſuch wicked Men, that it is but a shadow, not ſo much for the brevity of it, as that it is driven on without that ſubſtantial and ſolid Life of Grace and Comfort, and as laſt shall totally as a shadow evanish. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> By ſetting down the cauſe of all the Wrath that comes upon thoſe wicked Men (which alſo is the Mother of their other Sins) to be the want of a Filial Fear of God. <hi>ver. 13.</hi> As alſo he amplifieth the former conſolation given to the Godly, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſetting down the ground of their diſcouragement to be, That ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (tho' the Reaſon of it be not generally obvious to Men) it falleth out in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (not without the Fore-knowledge, wiſe Ordering and Permisſion of God) that the Godly are dealt with in the World, as to their outward lot, no better than the worſt of Men, and the wicked, as if they were the beſt of Men in the World; which he cenſureth as a Vanity, not as reflecting on the Wiſe and Holy Providence of God, but as it is the fruit of Mens corruption (eſpecially wicked Rulers) who are inſtrumental in it, and as it proves the Vanity of any earthly condition for affording Men true Happineſs. <hi>ver. 14.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> He affordeth a Remedy againſt diſcouragement from, and ſtumbling at, theſe Diſpenſations; namely, the exerciſe of Spiritual [not Carnal) Mirth or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing. <hi>ver. 15.</hi> Which he commendeth partly from the advantage of it, that it is the beſt of it in this Life, even under ſad Diſpenſations, to be cheerful in the lawful and ſober uſe of the outward Comforts (be they great or ſmall) which God allows upon them. <hi>ver. 15.</hi> And partly from the ſecurity of it to them, as

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> being in the firſt part of this Chapter to give ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Directions for the manifeſting of Heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a Chriſtians Converſation, in order to the true Peace and Tranquility of his Mind. He doth in this Verſe <hi>Firſt</hi> commend the perſon indued with that Knowledge, <hi>Who is as the Wiſe Man?</hi> The Queſtion may be explained by a Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, There is none to be compared with the Man that hath that excellent Knowledge which <hi>Paul</hi> commends, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. there is not his Match or Peer in all the World beſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He deſcribes him who is indued with this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in another Queſtion, <hi>Who knows the interpretation of a thing?</hi> Importing that he who is truly Wiſe doth know it,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51442:206"/>
that is, he takes up the Mind of God in His Word, and in His Works, and can in ſome meaſure clearly explain the ſame to others, according to his Place and Calling. The Queſtion alſo imports that there are few of ſuch to be found. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He commends this Knowledge from two lovely and deſirable effects of it. 1. That it <hi>makes a Mans Face to ſhine,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if it put always ſuch a Divine Luſtre, and viſible Beauty upon them that have it, as was upon the Faces of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> though the Expreſſion here may allude to that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But by <hi>the ſhining of the Face</hi> is meant, the appearing of the Beauty of Holineſe in the Mans outward Deportmen, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. and ſuch an Holy Cheerfulneſs, as makes him lovely to all diſcerning On-lookers. 2. <hi>That the boldneſs of his Face ſhall be changed.</hi> the Words may be tranſlated the <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Courage</hi> of his Countenance ſhall be <hi>doubled,</hi> that is, A Mans knowledge of God in Chriſt, and of his Duty, ſhall make him bold as a Lyon in following of his Duty, and always his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> ſhall be <hi>changed,</hi> or <hi>doubled</hi> from one meaſure to another, as Difficulties are multiplied in his way. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. There is no Man to be found in the World void of the Saving Knowledge of God in Chriſt, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with him that hath that Knowledge, which teaches a Man to go out of himſelf to Chriſt for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9. to walk in the Fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. and to ſubdue his own Corruptions, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13.14. Let a Man have never ſo much worldly Wiſdom, Riches, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, theſe cannot make him worthy to be laid in the Ballance with a Man wanting all theſe, providing he have this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom, this is an excellent Man indeed, and there is not his Peer in the World beſide, as is imported in this Queſtion, <hi>Who is as the Wiſe Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2, They that have moſt of this Heavenly Wiſdom, they will prize it moſt, and the Perſons that are indued with it:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:51442:207"/>
For it is he who had a great meaſure of this Wiſdom, and knew alſo what other Qualifications and Gifts were to Men who thus preferrs the truly Wiſe Man as one matchleſs, <hi>Who is as the Wiſe Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heavenly and ſaving Wiſdom manifeſts it ſelf in the clear uptaking of the mind of God in his Word, and putting a right conſtruction and <hi>Interpretation</hi> upon his Operations according to the word, and being able to explain and clear the ſame to theſe under our charge, and with whom we have a call to deal, and ſo every one who hath either Child, Servant or Friend, is an <hi>Interpreter:</hi> For this queſtion may be taken for a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every truly Wiſe, and Godly Man, ſuppoſing him to be ſuch an one as is here inquired For: <hi>Who knows the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are few of theſe excellent Ones to be found who have this clear Knowledge to take up Gods mind in his Word, and Works, where the ſame is not obvious and needs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and to make plain the ſame to others, and who have an Heart to it: For the Paucity and Rarity of thoſe may be alſo imported in this ſecond Queſtion, <hi>Who knows the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As Luſts reigning in the Hearts of Men will readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray their power in the external carriage, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. So Gods powerful and ſaving Grace where it is abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lively in the Soul, will manifeſt it ſelf in the effects of it, upon the outward carriage and deportment of them that are indued with it; as is imported in this, <hi>a Mans Wiſdome makes his Face to ſhine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Saving Wiſdom manifeſts it ſelf by beautifying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indued with it, in ſo far as it ſets them upon an Holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſutable to the Goſpel, which hath a great Beauty in the Eyes of them whom the God of this World hath not Blinded: And in ſo far as it teaches them how to apply the Oyl of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Conſolations of Chriſts Spirit which <hi>makes their Face to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51442:207"/>
ſhine</hi> by humble cheerfulneſs, even in their ſadeſt times, <hi>Act.</hi> 16 25. And 6.15. For by <hi>the ſhinning of the Face</hi> is chiefly meant the <hi>divine Beauty of Holineſs and ſpiritual Joy</hi> ſhining in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Converſation, and this is made the effect of that Wiſdom which proves the Man ſingular and Praiſe worthy that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with it, <hi>Who is as the Wiſe Man?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A mans Wiſdom makes his Face to ſhine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. As they that know God in Chriſt ſavingly may reſolve upon difficulties and oppoſition in following of their Duty, againſt which they have need of much Holy <hi>Boldneſs</hi> and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſo they may expect to have as much hereof, as they ſhall not be forced from their Duty by any Oppoſition, that they ſhall become a Terrour to their very Enemies and Oppoſers. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10. That they ſhall have much humble <hi>Boldneſs</hi> and confidence toward God <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. And all theſe upon the growing hand, as Temptations and difficulties are doubled, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.9. For of ſuch he ſaith. <hi>The Boldneſs of his Face ſhall be changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Men deſtitute of this excellent and ſaving Knowlege, are but deformed in the Eyes of God, and ſpiritual Onlookers, though for external Beauty they were like <hi>Abſalom;</hi> they are but baſe Cowards, being Slaves to their own Luſts, though for Strength and Courage they were like <hi>Goliah.</hi> For the contrary of this muſt agree to the perſon that wants this Wiſdom, ſeing it is affirmed of him that hath it as his peculiar excellency, <hi>It makes his Face to ſhine, and the Boldneſs of his Countenance ſhall be changed.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is the firſt direction for manifeſting that Heavenly Wiſdom formerly commended in order to true peace and tranquility of mind, and it is to give Obedience to <hi>Lawful</hi> Magiſtrates in things <hi>Lawful,</hi> for it cannot be thought that he preſſes upon people, an univerſal or unlimited obedience to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:51442:208"/>
Kings or Magiſtrates, ſeing that were expreſly contrary to the clear mind of God in other places of his word <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19.20. And to <hi>Solomons</hi> own mind in this ſame place, as will appear afterward, and this derection he preſſes in a very Emphatick way, he being a <hi>King</hi> himſelf he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but rather ſpeaks as a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and though his mind be clear, yet it is not fully expreſt: For the word <hi>Counſel</hi> is not in the Original which is only I—<hi>thee to keep</hi> &amp;c. importing his Seriouſneſs, as if no one ſtrain could have weight enough for inforcing this Duty, and with all his ſparing to ſpeak impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, while he calls for that Duty which his Relation to the People called for to himſelf at their hands, and therefore is fitly ſupplied by this <hi>I Counſel thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Direction he inforces by a Reaſon that qualifies the Duty <hi>becauſe of the Oath of God,</hi> which may be underſtood of that general Oath or Covenant with God which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſuppoſed to be under, whereby they are ingaged to the obedience of his will in his ſtrength, and conſequently to the Duties of the fifth Commandment <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.21. And ſo it limits our obedience to Magiſtrats that it be ſuch as may conſiſt with the Duties of our Oaths and ingagements to God the Supreme Magiſtrat, or it may be meant of that particular Oath or Covenant which is between Prince and People to ſuch mutual Duties of their Relation, as are injoyned in the word of God in ſubſtance, and are only in that Solemn Oath or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant circumſtantiat and determined as to the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance of them, with particular application to the conſtitution, condition and Laws of every Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.3. And either of theſe ways it is <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> becauſe it ſhould be taken in obedience to him, it is made to him, and ſhould be made Conſcience of as in his ſight, who will puniſh the Breakers of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. That which Beautifies a Chriſtian, gives him much Courage and Boldneſs in his Duty, and ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:51442:208"/>
him to be indued with ſaving Wiſdom, is the conſcionable diſcharge of the Duties of his particular Relations, eſpecially toward thoſe who are above him: Be what he will otherwiſe if he be not conſcionable in theſe, he cannot adorn Religion, nor have Courage under Trials, for having commended the perſon indued with this Heavenly Wiſdom, and ſhewn the ſweet Advantages and effects of it, he comes here particularly to preſs ſome Duties wherein it is manifeſted, of which this is one preſt upon Subjects, <hi>I Counſel thee to keep the Kings Commandement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. True Religion is a good Friend to Civil Magiſtracy, by the Precepts thereof it gains them all due reſpect and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from their Subjects, therefore the beſt Policy of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats is to propagat the ſound Knowledge of Gods word, and incourage all the faithful Interpreters thereof, thoſe will keep down Sedition, and will preſs upon People by the ſtrongeſt Arguments all Duties that Lawful Magiſtrates can in Reaſon deſire from People: For the Spirit of God puts this <hi>Counſel</hi> in the Mouth of this Heavenly Preacher, to be Regiſtrat for the uſe of the Church, and preſt upon People by all Faithful Preachers living under lawful Magiſtrats: <hi>I Counſel thee to keep the Kings Commandement.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Every Man is ſo proud naturally, and loves Liberty and Licentiouſneſs ſo well, eſpecially to ſhake off the order of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority and Subjection which God hath eſtabliſhed among
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:51442:209"/>
Men, that they have need to be tyed by Oaths and ingagements unto their Duty, for this Reaſon imports the neceſſity of ſuch tyes, and that <hi>Becauſe of the Oath of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A lawful Oath between Man and Man, tying each of them to his Duty, is <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> becauſe it ſhould be made to him, and as in his preſence who will avenge the breach of it, and puniſh the breaker not only as falſe to Man but as perfidious to God; and becauſe by theſe Oaths Men only ingage to what is approven by him in his word, Oaths to do things Sinful or impoſſible, are <hi>Oaths of our own:</hi> Therefore he calls this <hi>the Oath of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Saving Wiſdom teaches Men not only to perform Duties, but to do them from right Principles and Motives, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Subjection to Superiours not only for fear of puniſhment from them or for hope of reward, or preferment by them, but mainly out of reſpect to God who hath injoyned the ſame, <hi>Keep the Kings Commandement, and that in regard of the Oath of God,</hi>

                  <p>THat the former general direction concerning due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawful Magiſtrats may be brought to practice, he diſſwades from theſe Evils that are contrary thereunto, and they are two. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is in theſe words, <hi>Be not haſty to go out of his ſight,</hi> whereby is not meant ſimply a departing out of the preſence of Magiſtrats, for that is often neceſſary, it may be done in obedience to them, and ſometimes the more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it be done, it is the better ſervice to them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.10. But it is a deſerting of Duty, and <hi>ſhaking off of allegiance</hi> to them, as the expreſſion elſewhere in Scripture ſignifies <hi>Jona.</hi> 1.3. Neither doth he by this diſcharge a flying from the fury of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:51442:209"/>
wicked Tyrants, ſeing that is warrantable in ſome caſes. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23. But the meaning is, that Men ſhould not out of raſh paſſion, or ſome diſcontented humour ſuddenly ſhake off Duty to Magiſtrates, and ſo turn Rebellious, or go from them to joyn with their Enemies, as <hi>Joab</hi> did with <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> upon a diſcontent with Amaſa's preferment, as is ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>Stand not in an evil thing,</hi> whereby he ſuppoſes men to be ſome way ingaged in an evil courſe, and ſeems mainly to ſpeak of Diſloyalty, and offending thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by deſerting Duty to them, or Acting contrary to it: And diſſwades from <hi>Fixedneſs,</hi> or <hi>Contumacy</hi> as the word ſignifies, in that courſe.</p>
                  <p>And both theſe diſſwaſives he preſſes by an Argument taken from tho abſolute Power, and great Terrour which often Princes and Magiſtrates have, the conſideration whereof ſhould make their Subjects the more cautious, that they do not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly, or raſhly incur their Wrath and Diſpleaſure. And this reaſon he ſets forth in three Expreſſions. 1. He <hi>doth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleaſeth him,</hi> Which is not to be underſtood, as if Kings were independent upon Gods Providence, or were not to give account of their Actions to any, which is proper only to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9, 12. In whoſe hand their Heart, and conſequently all their Actions are, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. And ſo they cannot Act but what pleaſes him to order or permit: nor is it to be underſtood as if they might lawfully do any thing they pleaſe, contrary to the revealed will of God, as if they might (for examples cauſe) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Rebel, or one whom they judge ſo, without a formal Tryal by the Law, or otherwiſe than the Laws of the Land, grounded upon moral Equity preſcribe, which were contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. But he ſpeaks of what often falls out in matter of Fact, that their Power is often as great as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, eſpecially in reckoning with Subjects with whom they are offended. The 2. Expreſſion is, <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there is Power,</hi> He means a King in the Exerciſe of his Power,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:51442:210"/>
and having his Subjects at his command (otherwiſe a King may be in ſuch a Caſe, that his Word will have no Power) if he but ſpeak the word againſt a diſcontented perſon who hath raſhly deſerted his Duty to him, there is not wanting <hi>Power</hi> enough to reach ſuch a man; and this is the ground of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he doth what he pleaſes, The 3. is, <hi>And who may ſay to him what doeſt thou.</hi> It is not to be underſtood as if none might controle Kings, or Supreme Magiſtrates, Acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Duty, and to the command of the Supreme Lawgiver, ſeing ſuch have been warrantably contradicted, and oppoſed, and had this ſame queſtion in ſubſtance propoſed to them, as it was by <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>David</hi> exceſſively grieving for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.5. And commanding to number the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3. To <hi>Saul</hi> by his Subjects reſcuing <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 14.25. And by the Prieſts to <hi>Uzziah</hi> invading their Office, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.28. But the meaning is, that beſide the Sinfulneſs of Diſobedience to Magiſtrates in things Lawful, or the ſinful way of refuſing Obedience to them in things unlawful, it is not ſafe in regard of outward hazard to contradict them, men that do fit muſt do it <hi>upon their peril:</hi> And therefore they that would prove themſelves indued with true Wiſdom, ſhould be loath to adventure raſhly upon their Diſpleaſure, that ſo if they muſt ſuffer from ſuch as are ſo abſolute in Power, and have ſo much Terrour, they may ſuffer with a Peaceable and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. They that handle the word of God, muſt not only preſs neceſſary Duties by Reaſons, but if they would gain right Obedience to theſe Duties, they muſt diſcover to the People, and diſſwade them from theſe Evils, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe Duties, eſpecially theſe inward Diſtempers of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which indiſpoſe them from their Duty: For, this Preacher having in the verſe before exhorted to Obedience unto Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrates, he here dehortes from the inward root of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion which is in Mens Hearts, namely their Impatience, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:51442:210"/>
and Paſſion, which make them ſhake off their Allegiance and Duty to their Superiours, while he ſaith, <hi>Be not haſty to go out of his Sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. However ſome Magiſtrates do carry themſelves ſo as they are not worthy of the Preſence and Countenance of good Men, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.14. Yet when men have reaſon to withdraw their Countenance and wonted Reſpect from them, they ſhould do it without Paſſion, or Perturbation of Spirit, leſt teſtifying their diſlike of their Sins, they reflect upon their perſons, and on their Authority which is the Ordinance of God, <hi>Be not haſty to go out of his ſight.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Though the beſt of men are in hazard to be overtaken through inadvertency or Paſſion in a wrong courſe, and being once ingaged are ready to perſiſt, and defend themſelves in what they have done: Yet Heavenly Wiſdom will teach men in that caſe humbly to retreat, rather than proudly to perſiſt in any evil way: for this ſecond diſſwaſive imports both the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ingaging, and of perſiſting in an evil way, and preſſes the receding therefrom even after ingagement, as an evidence or proof of that Heavenly Wiſdom formerly commended, <hi>Stand not in an evil thing.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. When the Scripture ſpeaks by way of Hiſtorical Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is to be found among men, particularly Kings and great Perſons, without expreſs approving or diſapproving thereof, the ſame is to be exponed by the ſcope of the place,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:51442:211"/>
and other Scriptures, as for example, when the Lord foretold by <hi>Samuel</hi> what the King whom the people deſired ſhould prove, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11. It doth not juſtify him to be ſuch an one, ſeing many things there ſpoken of him, are contrary to the Duties elſe where injoyned unto Kings; and ſo here if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>(He doth what he pleaſes)</hi> were to be underſtood as if he might <hi>Lawfully</hi> do what he pleaſes, then <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Idolatry, and other Iniquities had been warrantable. Therefore the meaning muſt be, that it falls out often thus; that when a King reckons with a Rebel or Diſcontented Perſon with whom he is diſpleaſed, <hi>He doth whatſoever pleaſeth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord permits often, and diſpoſes ſo in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Kings and Supreme Magiſtrates ſhould be very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and have great Power, ſo as few do, or darr control them: And this he doth for good ends, that his Pleaſure may be theirs, when they are put in a capacity to do what they pleaſe, for any oppoſition from men, that they may make their Power a Terrour to evil Doers, and if they imploy it otherwiſe, he makes good uſe of that alſo, for the increaſe of their Judgment, and for the trial of the Faith, and Patience of his own, who are Loyal Subjects to him: for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks here of what is often found in Kings, and Supreme Magiſtrats, leaving the ſpeaking of their Duty, and the limitations of their Power, to other places, <hi>He doth whatſoever pleaſeth him, where the Word of a King is there is Power, and who may ſay unto him what doſt thou?</hi>

Though the great Power and abſolute Authority which Kings and Magiſtrates do ſometimes exerciſe ſhould never make their Subjects forget their Subordination to God, or do any thing contrary to his Will, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.18. Yet the conſideration of it ſhould have influence to reſtrain their Carnal Paſſions, that if they muſt diſobey or oppoſe them for Conſcience ſake, they may do it with meekneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. And if they muſt ſuffer, they may do it with a good Conſcience, and the approbation
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:51442:211"/>
of God the Supreme Magiſtrate: for <hi>Solomon</hi> brings their Power, and the hazard of contradicting them, as a diſſwaſive from raſhneſs in dealing with them, and from perſiſting in any evil courſe, <hi>Be not haſty, ſtand not in an evil thing, for he doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth— and who may ſay unto him what doſt thou?</hi>

                  <p>HAving diſſwaded from raſh adventuring upon the Wrath of thoſe in Authority, he doth here preſcribe the ſafeſt way of walking, for eſhewing trouble from them, or induring the ſame with a good Conſcience, and that is by <hi>keeping the Commandement,</hi> he means mainly Gods Commandement, ſeing all the Lawful Commands of Magiſtrates are but Branches or Applications of his Commands, and by the keeping of them, he means a ſincere indeavour after Obedience in the ſtrength of the Lord, according to the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace, wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> was well inſtructed both immediatly by God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12. And by his Father, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.4. Who was well acquainted therewith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. and 71.6. And this he preſſes as the prime evidence of Heavenly Wiſdom, which he formerly commended, and here ſhews how it ſhould be evidenced, and bears in the ſame by two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That <hi>He that keeps the Command ſhall feel no evil thing,</hi> which cannot be underſtood as if he ſhould thereby eſcape all outward trouble, ſeing thoſe who are moſt ſincere in that Study, are often put to hardeſt ſuffering; but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that nothing which can befall him, ſhall be an evil to him, but rather ſhall be for his good. The <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon is, That <hi>a Wiſe Mans Hearts diſcerns both Time and Judgement;</hi> By <hi>the Wiſe Man</hi> is meant the ſame who keeps the Commandement, hereby evidencing himſelf to be indued with Heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:51442:212"/>
And this ſhall be his ſecond Priviledge, he ſhall be able <hi>To diſcern both Time and Judgement.</hi> By <hi>Time</hi> he means the fit Seaſon and Opportunity of his Actions, eſpecially in reference to the Commands of thoſe in Authority, as the foregoing words make clear; He ſhall <hi>Diſcern</hi> when it is a <hi>fit Seaſon</hi> to comply with them, and when to oppoſe them: And by <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Judgment,</hi> he means the clear underſtanding both of the Cauſe of Suffering, namely what Commands of Men are to be diſobeyed upon the hazard of the worſt from them; and what <hi>Commands</hi> of theirs may with a good Conſcience be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As likewiſe it may be underſtood of the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the defence of that cauſe in the <hi>Seaſon</hi> thereof: And the Wiſdom to diſcern all theſe, is only vouchſafed upon them who make Conſcience of keeping the Commandements of God that are made plain to them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. The greatneſs of the Power and Terrour wherewith the ſinful Commands of Magiſtrates are often back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ready to abate in the Hearts of the beſt the reſpect they owe to Gods Commands, and to draw them from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, the more terrible hazard of Diſobedience to God being only ſeen by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.23. Therefore the Wiſe Man having diſſwaded from raſh diſobeying of the Commands of Superiours, by an Argument taken from the greatneſs of their Power, which they often exerciſe in an abſolute way: He doth here guard againſt the other extreme, of obeying their ſinful Commands contrary to Gods, <hi>Who ſo keepeth the Commandement, (viz.</hi> of God) <hi>ſhall feel no evil thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men, ſo far as they have true reſpect to the Commands of God, can never be diſloyal to any of his Vicegerents, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their juſt Commands, theſe being but parts of his, and Obedience to them injoyned in the Fifth Commandement: And conſequently when the Commands of Superiours are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods, they ſhould then be obeyed as the Commands of God, and not as <hi>Theirs only</hi> for fear of hazard, or hope of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:51442:212"/>
Advantage from them: For <hi>Solomon</hi> that he may tye men to due obedience to Magiſtrats, preſſeth obedience to God by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Whoſe keepeth the Commandement ſhall feel no evil thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The true cauſe why Men living under Wicked Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats commanding things unlawful, make Shipwrack of a good Conſcience, either by inſlaving their Conſciences to obey their ſinful Commands, or by denying due reſpect to their perſon and Office, in the way of their refuſing obedience to them, is this, that they want due reſpect to <hi>Gods Commands,</hi> and do not believe the immunity which he hath promiſed, and will make good to them that are dutiful to him: for this is an Argument both to preſs obedience to Magiſtrats in things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to diſſwade from raſh and paſſionat Carriage, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect toward them, even in refuſing to obey their Sinful Commands, <hi>Whoſe keeps the Commandement ſhall feel no evil thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although Men who are moſt tender of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, may and often meet with theſe Hazards and Troubles which are accounted by many the greateſt of Evils, ſuch as loſe of Credit, Eſtate, Liberty, yea, and Life it ſelf <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. yet nothing that can befal them for following their Duty to God, ſhall be an Evil to them, but on the contrary all their ſufferings ſhall be for their good <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And ſhall increaſe their reward, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. by the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſhould ingage their Hearts to Duty, and patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for it: For (ſaith he) <hi>Whoſe keeps the Commandement ſhall ſeek no Evil thing.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. There is great difference of Seaſons in reference to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not ſuffering under wicked Rulers, which the Lord's People ſhould be careful to diſcern. There is a time when the Corruptions of the State, and wicked Actions of Men in Authority, are only to be lamented in ſecret before the Lord. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. There are times when more is to be done, as by Supplications and other means to pacify provoked or paſſionat Magiſtrats, as <hi>Abigail</hi> did <hi>David</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.18. And times of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51442:213"/>
bearing teſtimony openly againſt their ways, upon all hazards, as the Apoſtles did: <hi>Act.</hi> 4.8. And times for Men to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in their ſtation, as theſe Eighty Worthies did to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18. and the People to <hi>Saul</hi> in reſcuing <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.45. There is alſo great difference of cauſes, for which Men may oppoſe thoſe in Authority, or ſubmit to ſuffering from them, as ſometimes we may quite our own right in things Civil, rather than ſuffer farther in maintaining of it, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in <hi>Egypt. Exod.</hi> 5.12. There are other things again, which may upon no terms be yeelded to Men, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and God's Worſhip, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. And there is a right manner of maintaining the cauſe of Suffering, or oppoſing wicked Men in the due ſeaſon thereof; And both theſe, the <hi>Time</hi> and the <hi>Judgement,</hi> comprehending the cauſe, and the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of managing it, muſt be carefully diſcerned, and obſerved by thoſe who would not feel the evil which follows upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to ſuffer, when they are called to it, or upon ſuffering not for a weighty cauſe, or not in a right manner: For that there is ſuch difference of Times and Cauſes, and a neceſſity of obſerving theſe, imported in this, <hi>A Wiſe Man's Heart</hi> (in order to a right carriage in ſuch a Caſe) <hi>diſcerns both Time and Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not Mens natural Witt, or acquired Prudence that will diſcover to them the ſeaſons of doing or ſuffering, the cauſes of either, and the right manner of them, neither can particular Precepts be given for direction in all particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating thereunto; but it is the Wiſdom from above, learned out of the Word of God by humble dependence upon his Spirit to lead in all Truth, and to give in the Hour when Men are put to it, what to ſpeak, and conſequently what to act, and when and how to act (for it is only the <hi>Wiſe</hi> Mans Heart, to wit, the Heart illuminat with the Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and His Will, and poſſeſt by the Spirit of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) that <hi>Diſcerns both Time and Judgement.</hi>

                  <p>HAving ſhewn the excellent advantage that they have who are indued with Saving Wiſdom, to wit, Ability to diſcern their duty, and the ſeaſon thereof, he comes now to ſhew the ſad condition of them that are deſtitut of it: And though the purpoſe may be taken in the general, yet by the ſcope it appears, that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a main Eye to Mens deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe in Authority, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to every Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is Time and Judgement, therefore the miſery of Man is great upon him,</hi> it is not to be underſtood as if Man were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſerable, becauſe there is a fit ſeaſon for his Actions, and a right and a wrong in acting, for it would leſſen, yea remove his Miſery, if he had Wiſdom to diſcern theſe; But the firſt part of the Sixth Verſe being joined with the beginning of the Seventh, the ſenſe appears to be this, Becauſe there is a Time and Judgement for every Purpoſe, and the natural Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern either of them, therefore his Miſery is great: By misjudging of Cauſes, and miſtimeing of his Purpoſes and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he runs himſelf into many Inconveniencies: And this
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:51442:214"/>
ignorance, which is the cauſe of his Miſery, he ſets forth in two Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That <hi>Man knows not what ſhall be,</hi> which is not to be underſtood, as if the ignorance of future Events ſimply, were the cauſe of Mans Miſery, for then the Man that hath the greateſt meaſure of Saving Knowledge, might be equally miſerable with them that want it, ſeing it is God's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know abſolutly what ſhall be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.9, 10. But this, that <hi>Man knows not what ſhall be,</hi> may be underſtood 1. Of his ignorance of his Duty, at if the Words were rendered, He knows not what <hi>ſhould</hi> be, to wit, what he ſhould do: For the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſs duty after this manner in the future time, and ſo his ignorance of his duty, and the right manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, is the cauſe of his Miſery. And we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that this may be the ſenſe, becauſe the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſpeaks of the Time, which he join<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> before with Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Or 2. The meaning may be, That the Man deſtitut of Saving Knowledge, is not only ignorant of future Events, but likewiſe of all theſe grounds of Conſolation, that might carry him through them, be what they will; and therefore his Miſery is great upon him. And 3. It may be taken thus, He knows not what ſhall be, even ſo far as may be known by that Saving Wiſdom which he is commending, particularly by the light of the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore his Miſery muſt be great upon him.</p>
                  <p>For the other Expreſſion, <hi>Who can tell him when it ſhall be?</hi> It hath the force of a Negation, None can tell him, or none can make him capable, ſeing God hath not taught him, the timeing of his Actions, a right carriage in Straits and Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and how he may have true Comfort whatever future Events be.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. There is not only a Right and a Wrong in Mens Actions, and a ſeaſon for their Acting, which they ſhould labour to underſtand, but the ſame is alſo to be obſerved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:51442:214"/>
to Mens Purpoſes, and Reſolutions concerning theſe: So that they ſhould not ſo much as ſuffer their Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon, or encline to any courſes, till firſt they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Word of God as their Directory, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7. and implored God's Direction, who being acknowledged in all our ways, promiſeth to direct our paths, <hi>Prov:</hi> 3.6. that they may know whether the thing they reſolve upon be approven, and what is the right manner of doing of it, which is the thing he calls <hi>Judgement</hi> here, and what is the fitteſt ſeaſon and opportunity for the doing thereof, which is the <hi>Time</hi> here ſpoken of: For having ſaid, <hi>A Wiſe Mans Hears diſcerns both time and Judgement,</hi> in ſhewing the conſequence of not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe, he applies it to Mens purpoſes, or their <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>Becauſe to every Purpoſe there is a Time and Judgement.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The want of underſtanding of the Mind of God in His Word, concerning our Duty, and the due ſeaſon thereof, which is to be had by the help of his Spirit, who leads His People in all Truth, not only makes Men misjudge of things, and take right for wrong, even in their ordinary and civil Affairs, miſtake the right manner of going about what may be right in it ſelf, miſtime all their Actions, and ſo bring much guilt upon themſelves; but likewiſe it makes them very miſerable, while they raſhly engage themſelves in ſinful Courſes, neglect neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duties, or do them in a wrong manner, or not in their own ſeaſon; and ſo provoke God to blaſt their Undertakings, and render what they do unſavoury to others; All which might have been prevented by conſulting His Word, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conduct of His Spirit: For this Word tranſlated <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſignifies both Guilt and Miſery, or Puniſhment. <hi>Becauſe to every Purpoſe there is Time and Judgement</hi> (which Men labour not to diſcern) <hi>therefore the miſery of Man is great upon him.</hi>

                  <p>THe Preacher giveth here a farther Argument for the ſtudy of Heavenly Wiſdom, and proveth the Miſery of them that are deſtitut of it; The Argument is taken from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Death of all Men, which though it be true of both good and bad, yet it is here ſpoken of as a peculiar Miſery upon thoſe that are deſtitut of ſaving knowledge, they being both unwilling to dy, and unprepared for Death, and having nothing to comfort them againſt it, as the Godly have. The words may be looked upon as one ſpecial inſtance of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſpoken off in the words immediatly preceeding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no Man can know the time, and may be taken with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reference to the foregoing purpoſe, as an Argument to diſſwade Men from Raſhneſs in hazarding themſelves under the ſtroak of humane Juſtice from Magiſtrates, and to move them for that end to keep themſelves within the bounds of their Duty toward them, ſeing as he hath ſhewn before, they
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51442:216"/>
have power to reach Men eaſily that provoke them, and being once apprehended, and Sentence paſt againſt them <hi>there is no power in them to retain their Life:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it ſeems moſt agreeable the Scope, to take the words more largely as an Argument to evidence Heavenly Wiſdom, by timeous preparing for Death, becauſe of the neceſſity of it, and this he ſets forth in three Expreſſions. The <hi>Firſt, that man hath no power over the Spirit to retain it,</hi> may be underſtood of mans Impotency to retain his Soul or <hi>Breath</hi> as the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is in the Original) which is often held out in Scripture by this name. <hi>Jam</hi> 2.22. And that relating to the moment when Gods time is come to call for it, no Man then hath power to keep it longer in the <hi>Priſon,</hi> as the word <hi>Retain</hi> ſignifies: The <hi>Second, Neither hath he power in the day of Death,</hi> may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Mans Inability about the time of his Death not only to reſiſt Death, but to do any neceſſar Duty, he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily no power for any Action toward that time. The meaning of the <hi>Third, There is no Diſcharge in that War,</hi> is that Man can Diſcharge no Weapons to weaken the force of Death, for the word <hi>Diſcharge</hi> ſignifies Emiſſion, or ſending forth as it is uſed <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.49. as Men caſts Darts, or diſcharge Muſquets, or the like Engines of War, they have no Arrows to ſhoot at Death: Or there is no <hi>Dimiſſion</hi> of this charge no foreloſe, as the common word is, to ſhift this Combate which Men muſt have with Death; Thus he ſets out the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, and Mens Impotency to ſhift it. And becauſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men who by many ſinful ſhifts put by hazards, yea Death it ſelf for a time, which as they think would have come, if they had not followed theſe Courſes, do think themſelves in a manner in Covenant with Death, that it muſt ſpare them, while the Godly periſheth in his uprightneſs, as <hi>Solomons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is before, therefore that he may terrify and reclaim ſuch, he doth aſſure all, whether Magiſtrats or Subjects, that none of their wicked Courſes wherein they are reſtleſs, and whereunto
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:51442:216"/>
they have wedded themſelves, ſhall be able to prevent their Death or <hi>prolong their Life:</hi> as the laſt words of the verſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. All the Prudence, Power, and Policy of Men, all the Creature Comforts, the Cordials, and preſervatives of Life, that Men may provide and uſe, cannot keep in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul in the Body a moment longer then Gods time is come to call for it: Man hath ſome power over his Spirit to turn it, while his Life laſts, to reſtrain it from many things he lets it out upon, and to put it upon many better things, but he hath no power to keep it beyond the Moment fixed by the Lord for taking his Spirit into his hand, to diſpoſe of it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as he pleaſes: For, ſaith he, <hi>no Man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man ſhould ſo exerciſe his witt in the ſtudy of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, while he hath any power over the Motions of his own Spirit, and ſhould ſo ſpend his affections, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and delights of his Soul, upon things of a ſpiritual and eternal concernment, for the Glory of God, and the good of his own Soul, that he may be every Moment ready to let his Spirit go willingly, and to reſign it into the hands of the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits who gave it, conſidering that when Gods appointed time of calling for it, comes, he will have <hi>no Power</hi> over it to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> it: for this is an Argument for the ſtudy of Heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and reſpect to Gods commands, <hi>Man hath no Power over the Spirit to retain it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. However Men of great natural Spirits, eſpecially ſuch as are tranſported with the deſire of eſteem for magnanimity, and Courage, may ſeem to defy Death, and not to fear it, while they are not come to Combat with it, yet ſo terrible is it to all that have not made their Peace with God, and ſo made ſure to themſelves a better Life, that when it draws neer they will have ſtrong deſires to <hi>Retain</hi> their Spirits a while longer, and to have a <hi>Diſcharge</hi> from the Combat with Death, they having
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51442:217"/>
nothing to comfort and ſtrengthen them againſt the King of Terrours, and the fear of the ſecond Death, which is at the back of the firſt: for this is ſpoken to ſhake men out of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, who neglect the ſtudy of Heavenly Wiſdom, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Death, <hi>no Man hath power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit, neither is there any diſcharge in that War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the great Miſery of wicked Men, to be peremptorily called to render their Spirits, and utterly unwilling to part with them; to be called to Combat with the King of Terrours, and to have neither Courage nor Comfort in entering the the Liſts with him; and this is the caſe of all who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitut of ſaving Wiſdom, the conſideration whereof ſhould incite Men to ſtudy Reconciliation with God, and an Holy Walk, which breeds Willingneſs to Dy, and Comfort in Death. For as a proof of Mans Miſery ſpoken of before, this is brought in, <hi>no Man hath Power to retain the Spirit,</hi> it ſuppoſes Man very deſirous to <hi>Retain</hi> it even when he muſt part with it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Mens Spirits that are now Rebellious againſt God, and in a continual motion contrary to his revealed Will, muſt when Death comes move at his Command, they muſt flit out of the Body, and ſiſt themſelves before the Judge to be at his diſpoſal; the conſideration whereof ſhould deter Men from their ſinful Courſes: For <hi>no man hath Power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. While Men have natural ſtrength and vigour, they ſhould ſpend the ſame in theſe Exerciſes, the remembrance whereof may comfort them in Death, for when Death draws neer, Man becomes impotent not only to reſiſt Death, but to prepare for it, not only hath he no power to proſecute his Luſts farther, but no power for theſe ſpiritual Exerciſes, which he puts off to the Day of his Death, for <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this as an Argument for the ſtudy of Heavenly Wiſdom, <hi>neither hath he Power in the day of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. As every Man will have a ſore Conflict, and an hot Battel
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:51442:217"/>
with Death, ſo there is no Man with never ſo much Power or Policy, not the greateſt on Earth, who can have a <hi>Diſcharge</hi> or <hi>Exemption</hi> from ingaging in the Combat with it: Therefore Men had need to get the <hi>Breaſt plate of Faith, and for an Helmet, the hope of Salvation,</hi> and to ſtudy a wiſe carriage in an evil World, eſpecially when they have to do with Wicked men in Power and Authority, leaſt by their miſcarriage they ingage themſelves needleſsly in that War: For, <hi>there is no Diſcharge in that War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Mortal men can hardly be brought to have ſerious thoughts of the neceſſity of Death, and the impoſſibility of ſhifting the Combat with it, they live as if they could <hi>Retain</hi> their Spirits for ever, and forget to take their Armour to them, as if they were never to fight with the <hi>King of Terrours:</hi> Therefore the neceſſity of it, and impoſſibility of eſcaping it is here ſet forth by ſo many expreſſions, <hi>No Man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit, no man hath power in the day of Death, neither is there any Diſcharge in that War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. When wicked Men have had ſucceſs in their ſinful Courſes, ſo far as by them to eſcape temporal hazards for a time, they do them go on as confidently in them, as if they would always deliver them, as is imported in this threatning which contradicts Mens ordinary apprehenſion, <hi>neither ſhall Wickedneſs deliver thoſe that are given to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Whatever be mens apprehenſions of ſafety by their ſinful Courſes, they ſhall be ſo far from delivering them at laſt, that they ſhall bring total, and terrible deſtruction upon them: For ſuch ſparing expreſſions in Scripture ſpoken againſt wicked Men, import much more than is expreſt, even the contrary affirmative in the Superlative degree, <hi>neither ſhall Wickedneſs deliver thoſe that are given to it.</hi> importing no leſs than that it ſhall bring <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tter Deſtruction,</hi> from which there ſhall be no eſcaping to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. However all unregenerat Men, riſe not to a like height
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:51442:218"/>
of Wickedneſs, yet all of them are reſtleſs in committing of the ſame, <hi>they cannot Sleep unleſs they do Miſchief,</hi> or provoke others ſo to do, as the word <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> ſignifies, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in Sin, and wedded to their Luſts, as if they had made a <hi>Marriage Covenant</hi> with them, as the words Tranſlated <hi>that are given to it,</hi> ſignifie, <hi>Wickedneſs ſhall not deliver thoſe that are given to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Though any degree of Wickedneſs continued in, will bring Deſtruction upon Men, yet of all Sinners there are leaſt hopes of the Salvation of them who are become Reſtleſs, and unwearied in Sinning, and ſo pour out their affections upon their Luſts as if they were wedded to them, for ſo are the words in the Original, <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> (or Turbulency and Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs in Sin) <hi>ſhall not deliver them that are given, or</hi> have <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> or married themſelves <hi>unto it.</hi>

                  <p>

Learn. 1. Diſpenſations are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dark, but ſpiritual Diſcerners may ſee the Bleſſedneſs of the Godly and the miſery of the Wicked, even when they are ſadeſt to the Godly, and ſeem moſt favourable to the Wicked, they that have the Heavenly Wiſdom may ſee the Godly feeling no evil thing, and the Wicked injoying their Proſperity <hi>to their hurt,</hi> For the Scope of the words before and after, implyes the time here ſpoken of to be very ſad, and yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, he ſaw theſe ſweet effects of Heavenly Wiſdom, and the woful caſe of them that want it, which are formerly mentioned, <hi>All this have I Seen.</hi>
                  </p>

ſtreatching their Wit and ſtrength to the outmoſt for growth and progreſs therein, that which is to be known of God in any of His Diſpenſations, being a Depth that none can ſound: For even <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had before an extraordinary meaſure of Wiſdom, ſaith <hi>I applied my Heart to every work.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth farther illuſtrat the Miſery of Men void of ſaving Knowledge, how great ſoever they may be in the World. And this he doth for the Comfort of the Godly who are oppreſt by them. There are three things wherein ſuch Men place much of their Happineſs, namely in an Honourable <hi>Burial</hi> when they are Dead, a great <hi>Eſteem</hi> among Men while they live, and in the preſervation of their <hi>Memory</hi> after they are Dead.</p>

                  <p>For the <hi>Second</hi> they may have that alſo, they may <hi>Come and go from the place of the Holy. By the place of the Holy</hi> may be ſafely underſtood both the place of publick <hi>Judicatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And for the <hi>Third,</hi> the <hi>Esteem</hi> of themſelves which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhould be kept up after they were gone, he denies them to have gotten that, as to his Obſervation, they were <hi>Forgotten</hi> among Men, not as if it were of it ſelf a Miſery to be forgotten among the moſt part of Men, ſeing it is incident to the Beſt <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15. But he ſpeaks of it as a proof their Miſery, becauſe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:51442:220"/>
they place a great part of their Happineſs in perpetuating their <hi>Memory,</hi> as is clear from <hi>Pſal</hi> 49 11. and ſo the mentioning of their being <hi>Forgotten</hi> may ſerve to make them ſee the Vanity of their temper. And this affectation of Worldly greatneſs and a name among Men which hath this conſequent, and all the pains Men take to obtain the ſame, he pronounces to be <hi>Vanity,</hi> in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>this is Vanity</hi> ſaith he, which cannot be applyed to their being <hi>Forgotten,</hi> ſeing it is clear, he ſpeaks of ſuch as can leave nothing behind them Savoury, or worthy to be remembred.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The Lord may long ſpare Wicked men in their Sinful Courſes, and may not only along their Life, heap upon them more eminent proofs of common favour, than upon the Godly <hi>Pſal,</hi> 73.5.

                  <p>HEre <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a Reaſon why Wicked Men, eſpecially proſperous Rulers are ſo bent upon their ſinful Courſes, namely, becauſe the Sentence or threatning againſt them, which is publiſhed in the <hi>Scripture</hi> (for the Word <hi>Sentence</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Sentence publiſhed) is not preſently after their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sin, execut againſt them, therefore they imagine it ſhall be ſo always, that God is like themſelves and ſpeaks but to terrifie them, and ſo give up their hearts to commit Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with boldneſs and full delight.</p>
                  <p>From this Learn. 1. There is a ſentence paſt againſt every Sin and Sinner, It is paſt in Gods Eternal Counſel. <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.3. and publiſhed in his word where it is Regiſtrat, and was alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the People by them that did Regiſtrat it <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 10. And oftentimes the ſame is paſt in the Conſcience of Wicked men when they commit Wickedneſs, who cannot but apply theſe Sentences to themſelves as their due <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. And theſe Sentences can no ways be repealed, but by flying to Chriſt and being intereſſed in his ranſom and ſatisfaction: For he ſuppoſes a Sentence paſt and promulgat, while he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an Evil Work is not ſpeedily executed.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:51442:221"/>2. The Lord doth not immediatly upon Mens committing of Wickedneſs, execut his juſt Sentences upon them, as juſtly he might, but delays the ſame, that he may lead them by his long ſuffering to Repentance <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. that they may think of his Majeſty as deſirous of their amendement, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. And that the Equity of his proceeding may be the more clear, when at laſt he doth execut, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Therefore Sentence againſt an Evil Work is not ſpeedily execut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men void of ſaving Grace and the fear of the Lord, can not but abuſe his patience and long ſuffering, quite contrary to the intent thereof, by mocking his threatnings as if they ſhould never be execut, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. And intertaining thoughts of him, as if he were like themſelves in forgetting, or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind <hi>Pſ:</hi> 50.21. And ſo going on boldly in Sin <hi>without all fear,</hi> as the laſt words of the verſe may be rendred, <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil Work is not ſpeedily execut, the hearts of the Children of Men are fully ſet,</hi> (or are bold) <hi>in them to do Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no doubt but the Sentence againſt all the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continuing in their Wickednes ſhall be execut. Though it be not ſpeedily, it ſhall be certainly, and the longer it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, the neerer the Execution of it is, and the more terrible ſhall it be when it comes, for he doth import the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Execution, while he only concedes, it is <hi>not Speedily</hi> Execut.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What ever difference be among Men, from their natural temper, Education, or other things of that ſort, yet this is common to all whom Gods powerfull Grace hath not changed, that the longer he prolong his patience and indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, they go on in their Sins the more preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, they are the more bent upon their wicked Courſes: For he deſcribes the Diſpoſition of every natural Man, while he ſaith, <hi>The Hearts of the Children of Man are fully ſet in them to do Evil.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is the proper mark of an unregenerat Man, void of Saving Knowlege and Grace, to have his Heart fully ſet in him without reluctancy, or remorſe, to do Evil.

                  <p>HE Labours here to terrify ſuch Wicked Men as are long ſpared in their Sins, and to guard and comfort the Hearts of the Godly, who are apt to ſtumble at their being ſpared, and their own ſufferings from them.</p>
                  <p>And for this end, He <hi>Firſt</hi> ſuppoſes two things, which make Wicked Men dream of immunity from Judgement. 1. Their multiplying of their Tranſgreſſions, which he expreſſes by putting a definite number for an indefinite, and ſuch a number as points at the multitude of them, and may ſignify that God hath them all numbred exactly, how many ſo ever they be, 2 He ſuppoſes that while they are multiplying their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have their <hi>Days,</hi> and likways many other outward
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:51442:222"/>
favours multiplied upon them: For the Original of this ſecond clauſe is no more but that it be <hi>Prolonged,</hi> or <hi>Multiplied</hi> to him, which may comprehend both his Life, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Next,</hi> before he denounce or aſſert the certainty of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Judgement, upon ſuch Wicked Men, he doth as it were haſten forth a word of Comfort to the Godly, apt to be diſcouraged by the frequent oppreſſions, and multiplied In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of oppreſſing Perſecutors which are here ſuppoſed: And this he propounds with much confidence and certainty, <hi>Surely I know it ſhall be well with them,</hi> whom he deſcribes from that divine quality which is ſtamped upon their Heart, a Holy filial fear of offending God, which makes them obnoxious to hard ſufferings from Men: And the ſincerity of this fear is ſet out by the Object of it, <hi>they Fear before him,</hi> the words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal are, that fear <hi>before his face,</hi> importing that they have their eye upon the <hi>Terrour</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, which two properties of his are mainly ſignified by his <hi>Face</hi> in Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15.16. more than upon all the Terrour of fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He denunceth Judgement againſt the Wicked: with all importing it to be ſo great, that poſitive termes cannot be had to ſet it out, therefore he expreſſes it. 1. In general negatively, <hi>it ſhall not be well with him,</hi> and next more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, he <hi>ſhall not prolong his Days:</hi> He ſuppoſed him before to prolong his Days, and here threatens he ſhall not: both agree, he may have many Days, comparing him with others, even with the Godly, whom he may cut off, and haſten to their Happineſs, and yet he ſhall neither prolong his Days to that length which he deſires, which would be for ever in this Life, nor ſhall he prolong them to Eternity of Bleſſedneſs, being made victorious over Death, as this expreſſion of <hi>Prolonging the Days</hi> imports ſometimes in Scripture <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He deſcribes the Wicked Mans Life, his Days are <hi>but a Shadow,</hi> not ſo much for the ſhortneſs of them, being
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:51442:223"/>
compared with Eternity, in which ſenſe the Godlies Days alſo are as a Shadow, as in regard he hath nothing of that ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Life of Communion with God, which the Godly Man hath, and that his Life, in regard of any Comfort, totally periſhes, and is cut off as a <hi>Shadow,</hi> when the Sun of Gods favourable Diſpenſations ſets upon him at his Death, or when Judgements come upon him in this Life.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, He ſets down the cauſe of the Wicked Mans Judgement, which is alſo the fountain of all other Sins, and that is, the want of the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Men that give up their Hearts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Wickedneſs with full benſel of purpoſe and delight, are juſtly given up of God to become unwearied in the frequent commiſſion thereof: For he did formerly deſcribe the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all unregenerat Men, that their Hearts are fully ſet in them to do Evil, and here he deſcribes their common Practice in this ſuppoſition, that <hi>they do Evil an Hundred times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. While Men are multiplying their provocations, the Lord may in much diſpleaſure to them, draw out their Life in length and multiply their outward Comforts, which they do abuſe, and turn in fewel to their Luſts: For the ſame whom he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>to do Evil an Hundred times,</hi> he ſuppoſes alſo to have <hi>his Days,</hi> or any other outward and common favours <hi>Prolonged,</hi> or multiplied to him, <hi>and his Days</hi> (or and it) <hi>be Prolonged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. While Wicked Men are ſpared and proſperous in their Sins, grievous Temptations are ready to aſſault the Hearts of the Godly, amounting to no leſs than the queſtioning of a reward for Godlineſs at all, ſeing divine Diſpenſations ſeem to ſay that the Lord reſpects Ungodly Men by heaping favours on them, and ſlights them that are better: For to prevent the prevalency of ſuch a temptation, <hi>Solomon</hi> (before he ſhew what ſhall become of the Wicked) aſſures the Godly of the contrary of what they are ready to apprehend, <hi>Surely I know it ſhall be well with them that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:51442:223"/>4. Although the Lords forbearance of Wicked Men while they are multiplying Tranſgreſſions againſt him, cannot but occaſion much inward Grief of Heart to the Godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.158. And doth often occaſion much outward Trouble to them from the Wicked <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12, 8. yet neither of theſe can either marr or diminiſh the Happineſs of the truly Godly: For (ſaith he) <hi>though a Sinner do Evil an Hundred times</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet it ſhall be well with them that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord in denuncing Judgments againſt Wicked Men, hath a ſpecial eye to the comfort of the Godly, they are ſo neer his Heart, that even as it were in the midſt of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his diſpleaſure againſt the Wicked, he reacheth forth Comfort to them, and in a manner delays it not till he end his ſpeech to the Wicked, as here may be ſeen, <hi>Though a Sinner do Evil an Hundred times, and his Days be prolonged</hi> (before he perfect this ſpeech concerning the Wicked, he muſt comfort the Godly) <hi>yet ſhall it be well with them that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not eaſie to make the Hearts of poor Believers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are under Oppreſſions and multiplied injuries from the World, to reſt upon the bare word of Gods promiſe; and comfort themſelves concerning the ſweet iſſue of their pains and the Gracious Reward of their wel-doing, there being ſo much of a heart of Unbelief, in the beſt: Therefore doth the Spirit of the Lord teach the Wiſe Man, in propounding their Conſolation, to ſpeak with a kind of Aſſeveration, and with much confidence and certainty to beget the ſame in their Hearts, <hi>Surely I know it ſhall be well them that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is not a bare conjecture, or meer probability that the Godly have of their future Happineſs, and the Lords making out of his promiſes to them, but it is a certainty, and a firm perſwaſion wrought in their Hearts by the Spirit of God, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to reſt confidently upon his faithful word, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to believe, by giving them ſometimes the firſt Fruits thereof in hand: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks what he would teach all
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:51442:224"/>
Men that fear of God to ſpeak with application to themſelves, elſe they cannot have that ſtrong Conſolation, which is ſutable to the caſe they are ſuppoſed to be in here, <hi>Surely I know it ſhall be well with them that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Only theſe who have ſuch an Holy fear of offending God flowing from the believing Conſideration of his Soveraignity and greatneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. his goodneſs manifeſted to them <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 3.5. And his proneneſs to pardon their Sins <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. and ſuch other perfections of his, as makes them rather adventure upon the worſt that the greateſt of Men can do, than upon Gods diſpleaſure, by eſhewing Trouble from them, Only thoſe (I ſay) may perſwade themſelves, that it ſhall <hi>be well</hi> with them, and only thoſe can Comfort themſelves in ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt all their Sufferings: For, to ſuch only is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation held forth, <hi>it ſhall be well with them that fear God,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The true fear of God is mainly known by the Souls ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf <hi>before the Face</hi> of the Lord, apprehending him a <hi>Preſent God</hi> and witneſs of all its Actions, doing all as in his ſight; they fear God indeed who ſo apprehend his greatneſs and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as not to flee from him; his goodneſs ſo as to draw neer him; and ſo ſet themſelves ſtill as in his Countenance: For ſo the <hi>Fear</hi> of God is here explained, that it is <hi>a fear before him,</hi> or (as the word is in the Original) <hi>a Fear before his Face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Proper and poſitive Language is wanting to expreſs how ill it ſhall go with Wicked Men, when the Lords patience toward them is expired, and wrath proportionable to their Sins is meaſuring out unto all Eternity. Therefore doth the Spirit of God here and elſewhere. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.11. expreſs the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Wicked <hi>Negatively,</hi> which imports more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Torment and wrath than words can be found to expreſs. <hi>But it ſhall not be well with the Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. How long ſoever the Days of Wicked Men may be prolonged, even beyond the Dayes of many Godly, who are taken away from the Evil to come, yet ſhall they never be
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51442:224"/>
drawn out to that length which they deſire or imagine, that would indeed be an Eternity of time, ſo that in this reſpect they never live out half their Days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23. For (ſaith he) <hi>Neither ſhall his days be prolonged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Though for the ſhortneſs and frailty of this temporal Life, the Days or Life of both Godly and Wicked be but as a <hi>Shadow,</hi> in compariſon of that ſubſtantial Eternal Life which is afterward, yet the Days and Life of the Wicked being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that ſubſtantial and ſolid Life of communion with God, which the Godly have begun here, and continued thro' all Eternity, are but as the <hi>Shadow</hi> of a Life and Days: For ſo are they here called, <hi>his Days which are as a ſhadow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. As the want of that Filial or Sonly Fear of the Lord which was deſcribed (<hi>Doct.</hi> 8) is the cauſe of all the other Sins of Wicked Men, ſo is it alſo a clear evidence of Eternal wo and Miſery to come upon them, though they be for the preſent ſpared, and proſpering in their Sins.

He paſſes Sentence upon this, both in the beginning and cloſe of the verſe, <hi>there is a Vanity</hi> (ſaith he) and again <hi>this is Vanity,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if he had cenſured the Wiſe and Righteous Providence of God in permitting and ordering things ſo to fall forth. But it is <hi>Vanity</hi> in two Reſpects 1. In ſo far as it is the fruit of Mens Corruption who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in it, eſpecially Wicked Men in Authority, whom he mainly eyes all along this Chapter, it flows from, and doth evidence the Vanity of their minds, their Corrupt, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Humours, which are called by this name <hi>Vanity</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they do prefer and reward Wicked Men, as if they were Righteous, and oppreſs and bear down the Godly, as if they were the worſt of Men, this is their <hi>Vanity.</hi> 2. It is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in ſo far as it proves the emptineſs, or inſufficiency of any earthly condition for giving Man true contentment, and Happineſs, ſeing things are neceſſarily and wiſely ordered ſo to fall forth upon the Earth, Happineſs cannot be had in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He directs to one particular remedy of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement which readily is occaſioned by the ſight of theſe Diſpenſations, Then ſaith he, <hi>I commended Mirth,</hi> not carnal Mirth, which Men have in giving up themſelves to ſenſual pleaſures, as is clear by conſidering the ground whereupon he preſſes this ſame ſort of Mirth in the following Chapter ver, 7, to wit, Gods <hi>acceptation of Mens works,</hi> and therefore it muſt be a ſpiritual Rejoicing in God, as the effect of Mens Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the Bleſſed Iſſue of their Troubles, formerly ſpoken of,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:51442:225"/>
and it is the ſame with that frame of Spirit which the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians had in a ſuffering time, while they are ſaid to eat their Meat with Gladneſs and ſingleneſs of Heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46.</p>
                  <p>And this he doth in the fourth place commend by two Reaſons. 1. Becauſe there is <hi>nothing better on Earth</hi> for a Man, than to ſtudy cheerful ſubmiſſion to God, in the uſe of ſuch Creature Comforts as he allows upon him, what ever the meaſure of them be, and whatever the Diſpenſations of God be with him, it is his beſt, <hi>under the Sun,</hi> to rejoice in God, and to ſtir up his heart by the holy and cheerful uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Comforts of the Creatures, to the expectation of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life above the Sun. 2. As this is the beſt of it here, ſo this is made ſure to the Godly, <hi>it ſhall abide with him,</hi> not as if every one of the Godly did always attain to actual rejoicing in God; but that it is the Lords conſtant allowance to them, and if they do make uſe of it, walking in his fear and obedience, they may have his joy fulfilled in themſelves, and no man ſhall take it from them, amidſt all ſad changes, no croſs ſhall marr it all the days which God giveth them <hi>under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. As the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hold forth conſolations to the Godly, while they are threatning the Wicked, ſo if they would make theſe conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions effectual for their Comfort, they muſt inſiſt upon the Diſcouragements which marr their Comfort by them, leſt if they ſimply hold forth ſuitable conſolation, and do not branch out the diſcouragements to which theſe conſolations are to be applied, People may think Preachers little acquainted with the dint of the Temptations, wherewith they wreſtle, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> having given to the Godly that conſolation that it ſhall go <hi>Well</hi> with them. comes here to deſcribe theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations and Events which often marr their Comfort. <hi>There is a juſt man to whom it happeneth according to the work of the Wicked</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:51442:226"/>2. The Lord ſees it fitting that the beſt of his Children ſhould meet with as hard uſage in the World, as the worſt of Men have done, or could indure in their mortal ſtate, and this he does that he may mortify their corruptions, and prevent their ſharing with the Wicked in their future Lot 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. that he may try and ſo manifeſt to themſelves and others, the reality of their Faith, Patience, Love, and other Graces <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3. For <hi>There is a just man to whom it happens according to the work of the Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lords outward dealing with the worſt of Men, may ſeem ſo favourable and ſweet to them for the preſent, as if they were the beſt ſervants that he had upon the earth, that he may thereby invite them to ingage themſelves in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. and may heap Coals of fire upon their Head if they will not: For this is the other part of this Diſpenſation, <hi>There be wicked men to whom is happeneth according to the work of the Righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is only in this ſtate that we are in upon Earth, that matters fall forth thus: in the other life the difference of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations with the Godly and the Wicked ſhall be fully clear, For ſaith he, <hi>There is a Vanity which is done</hi> upon the Earth (we may be ſure no where elſe) <hi>a just man to whom it happeneth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the work of the Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. However the Lords Diſpenſation in ordering outward things to fall forth to the Godly and Wicked, as is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, be moſt wiſe and Holy, yet the ſame as men ate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in it, proves their condition here to be <hi>Vain,</hi> that is, that Happineſs cannot be had by the injoyment of things earthly, and that every man is <hi>Vain</hi> who ſeeks it in them: For <hi>Solomon</hi> reflecting not upon the Lords Diſpenſation in ordering things thus, but upon mens corruption, and their Lot in this World paſſes this ſentence, <hi>There is a</hi> Vanity <hi>which is done upon the Earth.</hi> &amp;c. and again <hi>this is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Children of the Lord ſhould not only make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:51442:226"/>
of rejoicing and Spiritual Mirth, when Diſpenſations are favourable and according to their mind, but when they are moſt grievous to carnal Senſe, and Reaſon; If they can then rejoice, the power of divine conſolations, and the reality of their Faith will be moſt apparent: For it is <hi>when is happens to the juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the work of the Wicked,</hi> and contrary, that <hi>Solomon</hi> commends this frame of Spirit to be ſtudied by the Godly, <hi>then I commended Mirth</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To rejoice in God, and to comfort our ſelves in the hope of the promiſed reward, and ſo cheerfully to ſubmit to the worſt that can befall us in his way, is the beſt condition a Child of God can be in, in this World, ſpiritual Joy and Cheerfulneſs being that which makes all duties ſavoury and acceptable to God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7 is bleſt with encreaſe of ſtrength for every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and difficulty <hi>Neh</hi> 8.10. keeps the Soul fit for farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of his love <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.5. And commends Religion, making it lovely to others <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46.47. For he gives this as a Reaſon why he commended <hi>Mirth,</hi> becauſe <hi>a man hath nothing better under the Sun, then to eat and drink and to be Merry,</hi> to wit in a ſpiritual and holy manner.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Lords People ſhould not only draw matter of rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his word and promiſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. And from the ſpecial taſtes of his Love which he beſtows upon them. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. But even from their common creature comforts, and they cannot but do ſo, if they take them all as ſtreams flowing from the fountain of Gods ſpecial Grace and love to them <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5. And if they do not this, they have but the Beaſts Happines: For <hi>there is nothing better, then to eat and drink,</hi> and ſo upon that occaſion <hi>to be Merrie</hi> in the Lord,</p>
                  <p n="9">9. However that meaſure of outward Comforts, ſuch as Meat, Drink and the like, which the Lord allows upon his people, be ſometimes leſs, and ſometimes more, and the beſt of them may be put to great ſtraits for want of theſe things yet as much of them as may occaſion their Joy in him, they
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:51442:227"/>
ſhall never want, as long as God mindes to continue Life with them, and take ſervice from them, <hi>when they have nothing they ſhall be as if they poſseſt all things, being taught of him to have and to want, and in all eſtates to be content:</hi> For in this ſenſe it is his conſtant allowance to his own, <hi>That ſhall abide with him of his Labour, the days of his life which God giveth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Spiritual Mirth and joy in God, occaſioned by the uſe of creature Comforts, is only allowed upon theſe, who are painfully imployed in ſome honeſt Labour, both outward in their callings, and ſpiritual in the practiſe of commanded duties, and not upon thoſe who live in idleneſs, or eat and drink the gain of Falſhood and oppreſſion: For (ſaith he) that ſhall abide with him of <hi>his Labour.</hi>

                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:51442:227"/>THe Preacher having commended the ſtudy of Heavenly Wiſdom, and ſhewn how the Lord's People by the uſe thereof may have Comfort under the ſadeſt Diſpenſations; He doth here by relating his own experience labour to humble all the Students of that Wiſdom, in the ſenſe of their own weakneſs, and impotency to comprehend <hi>Fully,</hi> or to ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Works of God's Providence in the Government of this World, eſpecially theſe Diſpenſations which ſeem ſo favourable to the Wicked, and ſevere to the Godly, that ſo they may be brought to Reverence, and ſubmit unto the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity, and unſearchable Wiſdom of God manifeſted in theſe Diſpenſations, though they cannot ſatisfy themſelves as to the Reaſons of them, nor reconcile the difference which ſeems to be between the Promiſes and the Threatnings of the Word, upon the one part, and the dealing of the Lord with Good and Bad upon the other.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be the main ſcope of theſe two Verſes, and in expreſſing hereof, <hi>Solomon</hi> doth <hi>Firſt</hi> give account of his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Study to underſtand the Mind of God in his Diſpenſations, and this in ſeveral Particulars. 1. His ſeriouſneſs therein, he applied, or as the Word is, <hi>He gave away his Heart to know Wiſdom.</hi> This <hi>to know Wiſdom,</hi> is not a Tautology, but it is to get the experimental and heart affecting Knowledge, as the Expreſſion ſignifies, of what he did in ſome meaſure know, or that he laboured ſo to reflect upon his own knowledge, as he might be ſutably affected therewith. 2. He ſhews how large the ſubject of his ſtudy was, <hi>The Buſineſs that is done upon the Earth. Buſineſs,</hi> as the Word ſignifies, is the humbling and toilſome exerciſe which God carves out to Men, and which Men undertake in the World; ſo that the object of his Study, was both Humane Affairs, and Divine Diſpenſations, which are both to be conſidered in one and the ſame thing. 3. His extraordinary diligence and pains in that ſtudy, which he doth modeſtly propoſe in the third perſon, as if he were ſpeaking of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:51442:228"/>
others, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither Night nor Day taketh ſleep,</hi> which though it may be true of Mens exceſſive care, and anxiety about things Worldly, or of their pains in the ſtudy of Knowledge; yet by the Scope and Coheſion of theſe two Verſes, wherein he relates only his own experience, it is moſt fitting to apply it to himſelf as ſpeaking modeſtly of his own pains in the perſon of others, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. The 4. Thing concerning his ſtudy, is the main and principal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I beheld all the Works of God;</hi> The meaning is, that while he was exerciſed as he hath expreſt in the former three Particulars, the main thing that took up his Heart was to underſtand what the Lord intended by all his Diſpenſations, ſo far as the Light of the Word, and Spirit of God might lead him, and what was the uſe God would have Men to make of all theſe, this was his Study.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He gives account of his ſucceſs in this painful Study, and that was, he had learned one profitable Leſſon, namely that he was a bad Scholar, and ſo might every Man find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he found, <hi>That a Man cannot find out the Work of God,</hi> which may be either applied to Men in Nature improving their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts, with that common aſſiſtance and influence which is not ordinarly denied unto them, to the outmoſt; And then the meaning is, that they cannot find out any thing conducing to their true Happineſs: Or it may be applied to Men indued with Saving Knowledge, and having God's Spirit preſent with them, in the meaſure that he ſees fitting; And ſo the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, they cannot in this ſtate fully comprehend nor know all that is to be known of God in his Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He giveth the reaſon of this deficiency, taken from Mans weakneſs, and this he illuſtrats by ſuppoſing him to have four Advantages in his Study. 1. Suppoſe he take never ſo much pains and labour in the uſe of means. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his ſearch be never ſo accurat, as is imported in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; though a Man <hi>Labour</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>painfully</hi> to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51442:228"/>
labour) to ſeek it out, the Word ſignifies to ſeek ſeriouſly and aſſiduouſly. 3. Suppoſe him to have a Stock of Wiſdom to trade with in his Study, and that of the beſt ſort: For in this Book, the Godly, or the Perſon indued with Saving Knowledge is ordinarly deſigned by the Name, <hi>The Wiſe Man.</hi> And 4. Suppoſe this Wiſe Man to have a fixed Reſolution, and to have engaged himſelf expreſsly never to give over his ſearch. <hi>Though he think to know it,</hi> the Word is, though he <hi>Say</hi> it, or though he <hi>Purpoſe</hi> it, <hi>yet he ſhall not be able to find it,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it fully, ſo as he may be ſatisfied with any meaſure of Knowledge he hath attained, but muſt Adore and Reverence God, as moſt Righteous, Wiſe and Holy in all his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though he cannot ſee a reaſon of many of them; yea though the contrary ſhould appear to his Carnal Reaſon and Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. So dull are the Hearts of the Beſt in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up things profitable, and ſo apt to weary and wander in the ſtudy thereof, that both Miniſters in ſtudy of the Truth, and People in hearing of it delivered, have need frequently and ſeriouſly to <hi>Apply</hi> and give up their Hearts of new to the ſame, and to be exhorted to Attention. For <hi>Solomon</hi> often before hath expreſt this his ſerious and accurate ſtudy of the Truth, and here he doth it again, importing that he held his Heart to it, and that thoſe who ſhould read or hear this Book would need often ſuch a new Preface as is here, to quicken their Attention, <hi>When I applied,</hi> or gave <hi>my Heart</hi> away <hi>to know Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even thoſe who have attained to moſt diſtinct apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Truth, and ſuch clear Conceptions of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which ought to be made upon the Lord's Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they may be able to inform and inſtruct others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, ought not to ſatisfy themſelves herewith, but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their own knowledge of theſe things, that they may get their Hearts affected ſutably to thoſe Impreſſions of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51442:229"/>
Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Love, and other Properties of God which may be ſeen in his Diſpenſations, and muſt enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with particular inſtances of the things they know, and have obſerved concerning the Lord's dealing with particular Perſons in ſuch and ſuch Caſes, that their knowledge may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come experimental. For this is to <hi>know Wiſdom,</hi> to which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> gave away his Heart; <hi>When I applied my Heart to know Wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that would grow in Saving Knowledge muſt not only ſtudy the Scriptures, and Works of Creation, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.1. but they muſt alſo <hi>Apply their Hearts</hi> to the ſerious conſideration of God's Works of Providence in the World, that they may ſee how conſonant theſe are to the Word, how Threatning and Promiſes are by theſe daily fulfilled, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the conſideration of the Carriage and <hi>Buſineſses</hi> of Men, both their painful toil and labour in their ſinful Courſes, that they may ſee their folly, and deteſt their way; and the pains of good Men in what is right, that they may approve thereof, draw matter of Praiſe there from, and be provoked to imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For all this is comprehended under the object of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s ſtudy, <hi>And to ſee the Buſineſs that is done upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not only are Men who ſerve <hi>Mammon</hi> and their Luſts, exceſſive in their pains, and for love to their Idols cruel to themſelves; but even the beſt of God's Children in their moſt approven Studies, are ſometimes in hazard to exceed in pains alſo, partly through love to their own Credit, and partly for want of humble dependance on God, which abates the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intention of their Spirits, and ſweetens their Study. For as this Expreſſion, which ſeems to import ſome exceſs in pains, ſeing the <hi>Night</hi> is appointed for Man's reſt, and then the Lord uſeth <hi>to give his Beloved ſleep,</hi> is true of wicked Men, ſo may it be taken here eſpecially in reference to <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his pains in his ſtudy, <hi>There is that neither</hi> Night nor Day <hi>ſeeth ſleep with his Eyes.</hi>

                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:51442:229"/>5. It is Wiſdom in Men to relate modeſtly their own pains for attaining to Knowledge, and not to ſpeak of themſelves as if they were ſingular therein, though their pains were never ſo great, leſt they appear to be ſeeking their own Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and ſo marr the ſucceſs of their great pains. For <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf, ſpeaks as it were of others as no leſs painful than he, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither Night nor Day ſees Sleep.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They that would become truly Wiſe, and would gain experimental and heart affecting Knowledge, by ſtudying the Events that fall out in the World, they muſt not ſtay their Thoughts upon Men, Inſtruments and ſecond Cauſes, but muſt raiſe their Minds to the firſt Cauſe, and exerciſe their Thoughts mainly upon his Work, that they may ſee what Properties of his are written upon all Events, as they are <hi>His Work,</hi> and what uſe ſhould be made of them for ſtamping the Heart with a Holy Fear of offending him, and for encouraging his People in his Service, ſeing theſe are mainly intended by him in his working, and muſt look upon all things that fall out as one intire Work in God's Hand, ſo ſhall they ſee that what is Fooliſhly, Sinfully, and Unjuſtly acted by Inſtruments, the ſame is Wiſely, Holily and Righteouſly managed by the Lord: For when <hi>Solomon applied his Heart to know Wiſdom, and to ſee the Buſineſs that is done upon the Earth, then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I beheld all the Work of God:</hi> That was his main Study.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though the ſincere Student of Saving Knowledge may be ſure of ſucceſs and progreſs in that Study, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. and ſome ſweetneſs to compenſe his pains, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92.4. and 111.2. and even the ſtudy of common and natural things that are within the compaſs of a Mans ſtation, uſes to be bleſt with Divine Inſtruction. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.26. yet none can expect in this Life fully to comprehend all that may be known of God in any of his Works, or to find them out ſo as to ſatisfy their Carnal Reaſon, but muſt ſtill be humble, and reverence the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51442:230"/>
unſearchable depth of his Wiſdom. For this is it which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> found after his moſt ſerious ſearch, that a Man <hi>cannot find out the Work that is done under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. As the Man that hath found his own inability to find out in a comprehenſive and ſatisfactory way, any Work of God, hath found ſomething worth his pains, to humble him, and make him reverence God's Wiſdom, ſo even this much cannot be found out till after great pains, and eſpecially till we ſtudy Events as they are God's Work. While one Man ſtudies the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of another, he may eaſily think to find him out, and to reach and over reach by his Wit, the work of one like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of this as ſome conſiderable ſucceſs of his pains, which he had after <hi>Applying his Heart,</hi> and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things as God's Work, that he found at laſt, <hi>That a Man cannot find out the Work of God.</hi>

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:51442:231"/>
uſeful Remarks he had made upon the Lords providences and mens dipoſitions and carriages under them. As <hi>I.</hi> That the imbracers of Chriſt, right entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Spirit of Sanctification, and Students of ſpiritual Wiſdom whereby they may know how to pleaſe God; They and all their ſervice and matters are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under his general providence and dominion as all other things are, but under his ſpecial favour direction and protection for their good, <hi>ver 1. II.</hi> That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods ſpecial love nor his hatred can be infallibly concluded either by perſons themſelves or others, from the outward events that are common to good and bad, <hi>ver. 1. III.</hi> (which evinceth the former Remark) what ever difference the Lord put betwixt the Godly and the wicked in his outward Diſpenſations at ſometimes and in ſome caſes, yet in his ordinary courſe of Providence, mercies and miſeries come alike to them both, <hi>ver 2.</hi> And upon occaſion of this that they may the better know ſpecial love or hatred which cannot be known by outward events, he giveth the different deſcriptions of theſe two parties thus alike dealt with as to outward events. Calling the one <hi>1,</hi> Righteous in regard of the imputed rightouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and begun inherent Righteouſneſs, <hi>2</hi> Good, having good in themſelves and Communicative of it to others <hi>3,</hi> Clean, tho' not from the inheſion and pollution; yet from the dominion and guilt of Sin, ſtill waſhing themſelves in the fountain of Chriſts Blood, <hi>4.</hi> Sacrificers, that is conſcionable and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Worſhipers, <hi>5.</hi> Fearers of an Oath, as being ready to perform lawful Oaths both to God and man, and affraid of raſh and ſinful Oaths. And he calleth the other, <hi>1.</hi> Wicked or reſtleſs in ſin. <hi>2.</hi> unclean, being under the Guilt and Pollution of Sin, <hi>3.</hi> ſuch as Sacrifice not, being neglecters and ſlighters of Gods Worſhip <hi>4.</hi> Sinners as being devoted to and ſold under Sin, <hi>5.</hi> And Swearers, as taking Gods Name in Vain, and adicted to raſh and falſe Swearing, <hi>ver. 2. IV.</hi> He remarketh the bad uſe which by reaſon of Corruption moſt men make of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Events: Not only the Saints through unmortified Corruption may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be diſcouraged in their duty, Murmure againſt the Lord and incline to ſide with the Wicked, <hi>ver. 3.</hi> But eſpecially the Wicked are thereby the more imboldned to Sin and the more inſolent in Sinning. <hi>ver. 3,</hi> Which if continued in will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate both in the firſt and ſecond Death. <hi>ver. 3.</hi> And <hi>V.</hi> He produceth two powerful conſiderations (the not minding of which may be the cauſe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned abuſe of this equality of Diſpenſations) The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof, To bring the Godly to a cheerful ſubmiſſion under an afflicted Lot, To wit, That the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt condition in the World hath advantages with it, which rightly improven may mitigate the bitterneſs thereof: in the diſcovery of which, He commends the ſtate of natural life (abſtract from the eternal condition) even tho' attended with troubles <hi>(1)</hi> From the ſociety of others to which a living man is join'd <hi>ver. 4.2</hi> From the ground of hope he hath that his life tho' for preſent ſad, may afterwads be bettered, <hi>ver. 4.</hi> which is illuſtrated by a proverbial ſpeech importing, That a living man tho' in a very abject condition (compared to a Dog) is preferable to the moſt eminent man (reſembled by a Lyon) when Dead, <hi>ver. 3.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> From the knowledge they have or may have of the certainty of Death which may
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:51442:231"/>
mind them of preparing for it, by a right improvement of the comforts of this life and a cheerful ſubmiſſion under their afflictions, <hi>ver. 5.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtirr up all to the right uſe making of outward comforts, is the certainty and neceſſity of parting with them at Death; Evidenced, <hi>1.</hi> In that the Dead are ignorant of the eſtate of affaires here on Earth concerning their Eſtates, Relations &amp;c: <hi>ver. 5. 2.</hi> That at Death they are deprived of all the temporal reward and fruit of their pains and labour. <hi>ver, 5. 3.</hi> That their memory which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to perpetuat ſhall be among men much forgotten, <hi>ver. 5.</hi> And <hi>4.</hi> Their love, hatred, Envy, and other paſſions as to their way of exerciſe here upon earthly Objects, is periſhed, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> And generally that they are no more that way concerned in things under the Sun as they were when here upon Earth, <hi>ver. 6,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the ſecond part of this Chap. from <hi>ver. 7.</hi> To the end, are contained ſeveral directions as proper Remedies againſt that deſpondency and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet which is incident to the Saints under an afflicted lot, and may ariſe from the conſideration of the equality of outward events to them and to the Wicked, <hi>I</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is the holy and cheerful uſe of creature comforts which God allows upon them, for ſweetning their life unto them even under their Croſſes. <hi>ver. 7.8.</hi> and <hi>9,</hi> Which he <hi>Firſt,</hi> Inſtanceth in three particulars. As <hi>1.</hi> in reference to dyet, that men take the ſober, ſutable, and chriſtian uſe of what meat and drink God allows them for encouraging and ſtrengthening them in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>ver. 7.2.</hi> As to Apparel and Ornaments of the Body, that they make uſe of ſuch comelineſs and decency in Apparel and Ornaments of the Body, as their ſtation will permit, and may expreſs their cheerfulneſs even under their Croſſes <hi>ver. 8.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> Conjugal ſociety, That being in a marriage-yoke, they are to live (eſpecially the Huſband who is to proceed in the duty) lovingly and cheerfully together, <hi>ver. 9.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> preſſeth by three Arguments. The <hi>1.</hi> taken from the Lords acceptation of their perſons and ſervices, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> The <hi>2.</hi> from the vanity of mans life and its ſubjection to ſo many miſeries, <hi>ver. 9.</hi> And the <hi>3.</hi> From the Lords deſigning outward Comforts to be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary encouragement and portion to the Godly even under their croſſes, tho' they have better things to look for afterwards, <hi>ver. 9. II.</hi> A ſecond direction for making the life of the Godly comfortable to them under a ſad lot and for right improvement of the former comforts allowed on them under it, Is, That they would uſe their outmoſt diligence in the performance of all commanded duties particularly in the proſecution of the duties of their calling, <hi>ver. 10.</hi> Which he preſseth by an Argument taken from the danger of their being deprived of opportunities, either of contriving or acting of good, by Death, to which every man is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſing, <hi>ver. 10. III.</hi> The third direction is humbly to expect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our endeavours not from our own promiſing preparations or Abilities, but from God; and that we be not perplexed with the diſappointments incident to human endeavours, <hi>ver. 11.12.</hi> Which he illuſtrats, <hi>1,</hi> By ſetting forth his own ſerious obſervation of the diſappointments that attend human affairs, <hi>ver. 11.2.</hi> He giveth ſeveral inſtances of this his ſerious Obſervation in things moſt
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51442:232"/>
promiſing for ſucceſs referable not only to natural and civil, but alſo ſpiritual concerns, <hi>ver. 11. 3,</hi> He affordeth a two fold cauſe of theſe diſappointments, The one is the not acknowledging the Lords foreknowledge and predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all events and their fitteſt opportunities, <hi>ver. 11.</hi> The other is, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the word and ſpirit of God for finding out the fitteſt ſeaſons of Actions, <hi>ver. 12.</hi> And <hi>4.</hi> He holdeth out what ſad conſequences follows the not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Gods ſecret and powerful providence in things, and ignorance of the fit ſeaſons of actions in two ſimilitudes of Birds and Fiſhes who through mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency are eaſily inſnared. <hi>ver. 12. IV.</hi> A fourth direction in order to the forementioned purpoſe, and for the better improvement of the former directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Is, The ſtudy of ſpiritual wiſdom, Illuſtrated. <hi>1,</hi> By <hi>Solomons</hi> ſerious conſideration of this Wiſdom, and his eſteem of the noble effects of it, <hi>ver. 13. 2.</hi> By a parable, or ſuppoſed hiſtory or (it may be) ſome particular providence falling out in his Fathers or his time of the deliverance of a city from a great ſtrait by the wiſdom of a poor man, when other means were wanting or did fail, <hi>ver. 14.15. 3.</hi> By mentioning the ungrateful entertainment that this poor man meeteth with, notwithſtanding his good ſervice, he is ſlighted and deſpiſed <hi>ver. 15.</hi> Hence, <hi>4.</hi> He inferreth as Wiſdom is better then ſtrength ſo when men want external advantages, they are by moſt men miſregarded, <hi>ver. 16. V.</hi> And then in the Concluſion of the chap, He doth <hi>1.</hi> Encourage to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prudent and humble communication and imbracing of the Doctrine of this ſaving Wiſdom even when it may not well be publickly avowed, and tho' by moſt deſpiſed, as proving more acceptable and ſucceſful in a a ſtrait, than the moſt publick and imperious edicts of wicked Rulers among their flattering and foolish Subjects, <hi>ver. 17. 2.</hi> He again preferreth this ſpiritual Wiſdom (knowing how ready we are to undervalue it) to all external means eſpecially where it is wanting, <hi>ver. 18.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> That one or few of theſe wicked perſons void of this Wiſdom being countenanced, followed and not mourned over and witneſſed againſt may deprive a whole ſociety of many mercies and draw on great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon it, <hi>ver. 18.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſcope of this Chapter being to inſtruct the Godly how to judge aright of the Lords Diſpenſations, and how to carry themſelves aright under them, ſo as they may have true peace and be free of vexation incident to them, <hi>Solomon,</hi> doth <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhew that notwithſtanding of mans inability to find out or clearly underſtand any of the works of God, mentioned in the cloſe of the former Chapter, he was not diſcouraged in the ſtudy of them, but gave up his heart to know what might be known, and <hi>purpoſed to declare,</hi> or (as the word ſignifies) to <hi>make plain</hi> and clear to the Church of God, <hi>All this,</hi> namely both the ſhortneſs of mans wit, and what he himſelf had found out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He condeſcends upon three very uſeful obſervations which he had made upon the Lords working.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Righteous and the Wiſe, and their works are in the hand of God:</hi> by theſe denominations the <hi>Righeous</hi> and the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> the ſame perſons in the ſame ſtate are deſigned, namely, ſuch as are fled to the Righteouſneſs of the Meſſiah, and are ſtudying Heavenly Wiſdom, that they may walk unto well-pleaſing, thoſe perſons and their <hi>Works,</hi> or (as the word is) their <hi>Service</hi> are <hi>in the hand</hi> of God, whereby is meant, not only that they and their matters are under the dominion of his Providence, as all things are <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.4. but that they are under his ſpecial favour and protection, under his Fatherly providence for their Good, as the expreſſion ſignifies, when it is applyed to the Godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15. <hi>Joh;</hi> 10.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>No man knows either Love or Hatred, by all that is before him,</hi> the meaning is, that neither the ſpecial Love, not the diſpleaſure of God, can be known to
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:51442:233"/>
men themſelves or to others by theſe things that are <hi>before them</hi> that is by outward events, which are common to good and bad: For of theſe things only as no certain and infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Gods favour and love he ſpeaks in this place, as will appear by the following reaſon, ſo that they do manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſenſe of this Scripture, who would from it infer that no comfortable aſſurance of a mans being in a ſtate of favour with God can be attained unto in this life: For <hi>Solomon</hi> only excludes outward events as inſufficient evidences of Gods love or hatred, as is clear both by this expreſſion in the firſt verſe <hi>no man knows Love or Hatred by what is before them,</hi> or (as it is in the Original) <hi>before their Face,</hi> and by the following words; but doth not exclude Gods own Graces beſtowed upon a man, and manifeſted by his own Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 12. from having evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his Love, eſpecially conſidering that ſo much of the Scripture is written for that end, that his people may know that he loves them, and ſo may have true Comfort. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. And 5.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third Obſervation is a Reaſon of the Second, that all things come alike to all, which is not to be underſtood as if the Lord did not ſometimes put a difference between the Godly and the Wicked, even by his Diſpenſations, by exeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Godly from theſe Judgements which often take away the Wicked, as is clear in the Examples of <hi>Noah, Lot, Nahab,</hi> and others, but the meaning is, that the Godly and the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are alike proſperous and alike afflicted, and rather the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are under the ſadeſt of Diſpenſations; and that he ſpeaks of outward Events, or as the Word <hi>Event</hi> ſignifies, Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Providence, is yet more clear by the following words, <hi>There is one Event to the Righteous and the Wicked,</hi> &amp;c. in which words he giveth ſeveral Denominations or Tittles of them that are in a ſtate of favour, and them that are not, pointing at their different ſtate and qualifications, by which they may diſcern themſelves and others alſo, ſo far as is fit for them to judge,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:51442:233"/>
whether they be in a ſtate of favour or not, although they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of this by outward Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Godly</hi> they are called 1. <hi>Righteous,</hi> not for any perfect and perſonal Righteouſneſs, but for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed to them, and inherent Holineſs begun in them. 2. They are <hi>Good,</hi> pointing at their <hi>Bountiful</hi> or <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> Diſpoſition (as the word ſignifies) which makes them ſtudy to do good to others, thereby reſembling their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and this is the Mark of a Juſtified Perſon. 3. They are <hi>Clean</hi> not from all Sin, as before Chap. 7.20. but they are Clean from the guilt of Sin, and are daily ſetting about the cleanſing of themſelves from the Pollutions that are in the World. 4. They are ſuch as <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that is, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Attenders upon God's Worſhip, whereof one part, which was the principal in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, is put for the whole. And 5. They are ſuch as are afraid to offend by Raſh or Falſe <hi>Oaths,</hi> or neglecting to perform Lawful Vows and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to God or Man, and by theſe Qualifications they may know themſelves to be beloved of God, who cannot know it by outward Events.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Next,</hi> For the <hi>Wicked,</hi> they are deſigned by ſo many contray Names as clear their ſtate and temper. 1. They are <hi>Wicked,</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) reſtleſs in their ſinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 2. They are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> under the guilt of their by-paſt Sins, and ſtill wallowing in new Pollutions. 3. They are ſuch as <hi>Sacrifice not,</hi> that is, they either neglect, or ſlight the Worſhip of God. 4. They are <hi>Sinners,</hi> that is, devoted and given up to their Sins, otherwiſe all deſerve that Name. And 5. They are ſuch as profane the <hi>Name</hi> of God by Raſh or Falſe Oaths, or otherwiſe, contrary to the Third Command.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. The unſearchableneſs of the Wiſdom of God manifeſted in his Diſpenſations, and our ſhallowneſs and weakneſs of Wit to comprehend the ſame fully, ought not to diſcourage us in the ſtudy thereof, but ſhould ſtirr us up to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:51442:234"/>
give our Hearts away ſo much the more to it: For <hi>Solomon</hi> having in the cloſe of the former Chapter, aſſerted that <hi>No Man can find out the Work of God,</hi> not the moſt painful and wiſe among Men, he ſaith here, <hi>For all this</hi> (or notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this) <hi>I conſidered in my Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As all that give their Hearts away to the ſtudy of the Mind of God manifeſted in his Word and Works, eſpecially thoſe who have an Office in the Houſe of God to teach others, ſhould make this one end of their pains, that they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what may be profitably held forth and communicat to others for their good, and not knit up their Obſervations like a Talent in a Napkin; So whatever any in their ſtations and places bring forth to others, they ſhould ſtudy to do it with clearneſs and plainneſs: For <hi>Solomon conſidered all this in his Heart, even to</hi> declare <hi>it,</hi> the Word ſignifies to make it <hi>Plain</hi> as upon a Table, that he that runs may read. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 However the Godly are apt to apprehend themſelves miſregarded by the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.22. and their Service reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.2. yet their Perſons and their imperfect Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice are in his Hand, their Perſons to be provided for, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and preſerved, till they come to Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28, 29. and their Service is in his Hand to purge it from the droſs of it, to accept of it, and reward it. <hi>Rev:</hi> 8.3. For <hi>the Righteous and the Wiſe, and their Works are in the Hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is only they who are fled to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and are ſtudying what is Righteous in his Sight, and for that end are endued with Heavenly Wiſdom, and ſtudying progreſs therein, who can take the comfort of this, that they and their Service are thus in his Hand: Therefore are thoſe to whom this Priviledge belongs thus deſcribed, <hi>The Righteous and the Wiſe and their Works are in the Hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Although the Lord's outward Diſpenſations are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo favourable, that they may ſerve to confirm and clear thoſe who are otherwiſe confirmed, concerning his Love and

Which cannot be underſtood as if he were cenſuring the holy and wiſe providence of God in permitting and ordering it to be thus, that outward Events ſhould be common to good and bad: But the meaning is, that as Afflictions to the Godly are of themſelves Evil, grievous and bitter to their fleſh, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten corrections for their Sins, and upon the other hand; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:51442:236"/>
is an Evil to the Wicked as it is a heaping of Coals of fire upon their head; So mainly this equality of Events to Good and Bad, is <hi>Evil,</hi> in regard of the bad uſe that moſt men by Reaſon of their corruption, make of it, eſpecially Wicked Men who therefore ſhake off all care of Piety, and wax bold in their Sins, ſeing they proſper ſo much in them, and in ſo far as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is unmortified in the Godly, the ſight of this equality of events, becomes an evil to them, diſcouraging them in their Duty, and often inclining their hearts to ſide with Wicked Men in their courſe, as appears by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.10. &amp;c. And this he calls an <hi>Evil among all things,</hi> or as the words may be rendered an Evil <hi>above</hi> all things, to point out the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or rather the hainouſneſs of this abuſe of the Lords Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, for ſo the Hebrews do ſometimes expreſs the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative degree, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30.</p>
                  <p>Next, He explains how this is an <hi>Evil</hi> to Wicked men, in two expreſſions, their <hi>hearts are full of Evil,</hi> which may be either taken for the cauſe why they make a bad uſe of their Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even becauſe they are void of the Grace of God, and full of contrary Evils, or rather for the effect of their injoying Proſperity, and obſerving the afflictions of the Godly, they give up themſelves to all ſorts of Wickedneſs, as if God were not diſpleaſed with their way, or would never be wroth with them, ſeing he ſeems ſo, in his Diſpenſations, to favour them. And this he inlarges by another expreſſion, <hi>Madneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in their Heart,</hi> &amp;c. Or (as the word <hi>Madneſs</hi> ſignifies) Boaſting, Pride, and Inſolency in their Sins take up their Hearts all along their Life.</p>

Death, puting a period to their Proſperity and ſinful courſes, and making them enter into Eternity of torment, which is the ſecond Death: And this is ſpoken to deterr them from their ſinful Courſes.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Theſe favourable and proſperous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, which wicked men meet with, and which they ſhould take for invitations to Repent for former abuſe of Gods goodneſs, and as engagements to his ſervice and obedience, who deals ſo liberally with them, are turned by them into occaſions of Sinning, made fewel to their Pride <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.6. and contempt of the threatnings, of the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.9. ſo do they heap upon themſelves by their abuſe of theſe things Wrath againſt the day of Wrath: For he ſpeaks mainly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Wicked Mens abuſing this Diſpenſation, that they proſper as much, yea often more than the Godly, while he ſaith, <hi>There is an Evil among all things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event</hi> &amp;c. <hi>alſo the Hearts of the Sons of men are full of Evil,</hi> &amp;c</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mens abuſing of outward ſucceſs and Proſperity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden themſelves the more in Sinning againſt God, it common among all that are unrenewed, and is a moſt hainous crime, being a Sin againſt the goodneſs and long ſuffering of God, and the occaſion of many other Sins, for both the commonneſs and hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it, are imported in this expreſſion, There is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>among all things</hi> done under the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though it be an ordinary deluſion among men, to think their Hearts good, were their way never ſo vile, yet not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the Hearts of all men naturally altogether void of any thing that is good, and that is the cauſe why they abuſe to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs the goodneſs of God manifeſted in his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but likwiſe the more of his Goodneſs they meet with, their Wickedneſs grows the more, their vitious habits, contempt of God, love to their Luſts hardneſs of Heart, and ſpiritual ſecurity grow upon them, for this may be either taken for the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:51442:237"/>
cauſe why they abuſe their Proſperity, to grow thereby <hi>Mad</hi> in their Sins, or for the effect of their abuſing of it: <hi>The hearts of the Sons of men are full of Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. As unrenewed men eſpecially in Proſperity do ordinarly go <hi>Mad</hi> in their Sins, violently proſecuting their Luſts, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Glorying in their ſinful ways, as if there were no account to be given thereof, as the word <hi>Madneſs</hi> ſignifies: So what ever uſe of their wit they may have to plot miſchief, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their purpoſes, and carry on their Plots cloſely, they are really <hi>Mad,</hi> incapable of any wholſome counſel deſtroying their own Souls, and taking pleaſure in ſo doing, like Mad Men: For (ſaith he) <hi>Madneſs is in their Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. While Men abuſe the Lords Diſpenſations, by flattering themſelves in their Sins, and perſwading themſelves of his love and favour, notwithſtanding of their Wickedneſs, becauſe they proſper; there is a ſpiritual diſtemper and <hi>Madneſs</hi> upon their Spirits: For it is mainly in reference to the miſ-judging of the Lords Diſpenſations, and making this wrong uſe of them, that he ſaith <hi>Madneſs is in their Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Men void of Saving Grace never weary of their <hi>Mad</hi> and ſinful Courſes, while Life or Strength continues, after they have along their Life abuſed their proſperity by Pride, Inſolence, Oppreſſion and Slighting of God, even when Death draws near, they but grow yet more <hi>Mad</hi> in Sin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining againſt God and his Providence, becauſe they cannot longer enjoy their ſinful Pleaſures, and ſo they carry their Sins to the very Gates of Death with them: For (ſaith he) <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is in their Heart <hi>while they live, and after that</hi> they go to the <hi>Dead,</hi> he ſpeaks of their ſinful Courſes, as having an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat connexion with their very Death.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As Temporal Death ſhall put an end to the ſinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wicked Men; ſo eternal Death ſhall then begin to ſeize upon them, whereof the Servants of Chriſt ſhould often put <hi>Mad</hi> Sinners in mind whether they will believe or not:

                  <p>THe Preacher giveth here two Conſiderations ſerving to work the Hearts of the Godly to a cheerful Submiſſion under an hard Lot in the World, and to ſtir up all to uſe their Life, and the Comforts of it well, that ſo they may prepare for Death. The <hi>One</hi> is, That the meaneſt or moſt afflicted Life hath ſome Advantages with it, which being improven may make Men digeſt the Afflictions attending it. The <hi>Other</hi> is, That they who have the moſt proſperous ſtate in this World muſt part with all the Comforts of it at Death: And ſo the Words may be alſo looked upon, as containing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mens madneſs in abuſing the Lord's Diſpenſations, as is expreſt in the former Words, namely their inconſideration of the Advantages of Life, and the neceſſity of parting with all the Comforts of it at Death.</p>
                  <p>In ſetting out the Firſt, he commends the ſtate of natural Life, while he ſaith, <hi>To him that is joined to all the Living,</hi> which is a kind of deſcription of any Living Man, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his ſtate. 1. From the Social temper which he ought to have, and the Advantage he hath thereby, <hi>There is hope,</hi> how ſad ſoever his Condition be, he may have hope that it may be better, or there is ground of hope to him, if he make
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:51442:238"/>
uſe of his Life, that he may get all the troubles mitigate and ſanctified, and ſo may prepare for a better, and this he doth illuſtrat by a common Proverb, <hi>A living Dog is better than a dead Lyon,</hi> which is a Speech applicable to many Purpoſes, and according to the matter in hand, the meaning of it is, that a Living Man who hath the moſt abject and contemptible Life, (for ſuch a Man uſeth to be ſet out by the name of a Dog in Scripture, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.13.) is <hi>Better,</hi> that is, he may be more uſeful for himſelf and others, than the Greateſt Man now being Dead. Here it would be conſidered for clearing of the following purpoſe, that while he compares the Living and the Dead, and preferrs the Former to the Latter, he doth not ſpeak of the Dead conſidered as to their future Eternal State, for ſo they are beyond all compariſon, either better or worſe, but abſtracting from that, conſiders them ſimply as by Death deprived of Natural Life, and the Advantages thereof. 2. The Second Thing that commends Life is, That <hi>the Living know that they ſhall Die:</hi> That which none can be altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, who have the uſe of Reaſon, and which all ſhould actually conſider, he ſpeaks of as agreeing to all, and this is a great Advantage if it be improven, that Men knowing this, may while they have opportunity prepare for Death, looſe their Hearts from their earthly Enjoyments, from which Death at laſt will ſeparat them, uſe their Allowance cheerfully for their incouragement in God's Service, and comforting of themſelves againſt the Afflictions of their Life, which is the Scope.</p>
                  <p>Now in oppoſition to theſe Advantages of Life, he comes in the next place to point out the Diſadvantages of the ſtate of the Dead conſidered as hath been formerly expreſt, and only mentions ſuch as point out the privation of Natural Comforts, becauſe theſe will weigh more with Men who ſeek their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this Life, than if he ſhould tell them of the Torments of Hell, or ſeparation from God's Favour. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That the Dead <hi>know not any thing,</hi> to wit, of the eſtate of Affairs here,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:51442:238"/>
As for Example, how it fares with their Relations, and the purchaſe they made in the World, and ſo he doth not deny the Beeing of the Soul after ſeparation from the Body, nor conſequently the eſſential properties of it, ſuch as the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Reaſon, and the like. 2. <hi>They have no more a Reward,</hi> he ſpeaks not of the future Reward of their Wel-doing and Evil-doing, which certainly abides both Good and Bad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.46. but of the temporal Fruit of their Labour and Pains which they have taken in this World, at Death they have an end of that. 3. <hi>The memory of them is forgotten,</hi> to wit, among Men on Earth, which is a reaſon of the former; they placed ſome Happineſs in perpetuating their Fame and Memory; therefore they are much forgotten, and ſo loſe that <hi>Reward</hi> they looked for. 4. <hi>Their Love, Envy, and Hatred are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if theſe Paſſions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Soul, were extinguiſhed at Death; the Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that retaining its own Nature, and doubtleſs there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love which caſts out all Fear in the Souls of Juſt Men made perfect; and there is alſo in the Souls of the Damned, Hatred and Envy againſt God and good Men, and againſt one another: but he means that theſe Paſſions and Affections of the Soul are at Death gone as to the exerciſe of them upon things in the Earth, which they are ſpent upon while Men live here. And becauſe it were long to reckon out all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this ſort, he cloſes with a general, <hi>Neither have they any more a Portion of any thing that is done under the Sun,</hi> which alſo explains the former, that he denies their Knowledge, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their Memory and their Affections, only in reference to things under the Sun, they have no more to do with theſe things. All which Conſiderations may wean Mens Hearts from this Earth, and may make the Godly content with a ſmall meaſure of theſe things, ſeing they that have moſt of them, muſt after a little time part with them, and never enjoy them any more.</p>

For here <hi>Solomon</hi> makes uſe of a Proverb, which ſeems to have no farther Miſtery in it, than to commend Life, though it be mean and afflicted, as deſirable, and ſo to be made uſe of for making ſure a better, <hi>A living Dog it better than a dead Lyon.</hi>

                  <p>THe Preacher here preſcribes a remedy for that diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vexation of Spirit which is ordinarily incident to the Godly, upon the conſideration of their hard lot in the World, and particularly, the equality of events formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: And that is the holy and cheerful uſe of outward comforts upon ſpiritual grounds, that ſo this life may be in ſome meaſure ſweetned to them. And this cheerful fruition of the Lords allowance, he preſſeth in ſeveral inſtances, and by ſeveral Arguments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt inſtance is, that men ſhould <hi>eat their Bread with Joy, and drink their Wine with a merry Heart,</hi> in which words he doth not excite to ſenſuality, or exceſs of carnal Pleaſures, but to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber holy, and cheerful uſe of that meaſure of the Creatures, which is appointed for ſtrengthening and refreſhing nature in Gods ſervice, and which is ſutable to every mans rank and condition And ſo it is the ſame in ſubſtance with that which is ſpoken of the primitive Chriſtians, that they <hi>did eat their Meat with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſingleneſs of Heart Praiſing God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46, 47. And this appears by the firſt Reaſon whereby he preſſes this, which is a ground purely ſpiritual: For (ſaith he) <hi>God now accepteth thy works,</hi> whereby it is clear that he ſpeaks to a reconciled perſon, who by theſe outward Bleſſings is encouraged in the duties of his calling, and is in ſome meaſure confident that God is well pleaſed with his ſincere pains in ſerving him, and upon that ground hath the more ſpiritual. Comfort in making uſe of outward Comforts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Next</hi> inſtance is in the matter of apparel, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deportment of the Body, <hi>Let thy Garments be always white,</hi> whereby is meant no farther, but ſuch decency and comelineſs of Apparel (which may be in the uſe of the courſeſt cloathing) as every ones rank and condition permits, and may expreſs
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:51442:241"/>
their ſpiritual Joy and cheerfulneſs even under their croſſes, and this he expreſſes in terms taken from the Cuſtoms that were uſed in theſe Countries at feſtivals or times of rejoicing <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8.15. And the ſame he holds forth in another expreſſion, <hi>and let thy Head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of anointing the head in times of rejoicing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.3. From which they did abſtain in times of Humiliation <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.3.</p>
                  <p>The Third Inſtance is, Of the uſe of Conjugal Society, <hi>Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou loveſt,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks of honeſt and chaſt Love, which married Perſons have, and adds two farther Reaſons, The <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> is, that the days of this Life are <hi>Vain,</hi> that is, ſubject to many Miſerits, and this he repeats twice, to make it take the deeper impreſſion, and to incite Men to Praiſe Him who hath allowed any thing to ſweeten ſo vain a Life, and to keep them mindful of it in the midſt of the greateſt plenty of theſe outward Enjoyments. The <hi>Other</hi> Reaſon is, that this comfortable Enjoyment of outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, is a temporary Portion carved out for incouragement to the Godly, who have better things in another Life to look for, and therefore no Diſcouragements ſhould hinder them from taking the comfortable uſe of his Allowance.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. Of all Men in the World the Godly may moſt freely and cheerfully uſe that meaſure of the Creature Comforts, which the Lord beſtows upon them, they only hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſanctified uſe of theſe things, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. ſo that it is a groundleſs prejudice which Carnal Minds have againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:51442:242"/>
and the exerciſe of Piety, as if they did foſter Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. For to the Godly Man is this ſpoken, <hi>Go thy way, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart,</hi> for God accepteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although the Godly have grounds of Rejoicing, which are of a higher nature than the beſt of outward Comforts, even their Juſtification, and Peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. &amp;c. which are able to cheer their Hearts, when theſe Creature Comforts are wanting, or not comfortable, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.18. yet when the Lord lays thoſe things to their Hand, they ought to uſe them with freedom and cheerfulneſs, and in obedience to His Command, as a Remedy againſt their Diſcouragement, and a Diverſion from ſuch ſad Thoughts as ſpend their Spirits, and marr their Joy in His Service; that their Natural Spirits being refreſhed by thoſe things, they may bear their Croſſes with the more courage a Por ſuppoſing always that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth afterward, that Man's Life is <hi>Vain,</hi> or ſubject to many Miſeries, he preſcribes this as a Remedy againſt the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which may ariſe therefrom, <hi>Go thy way, eat thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Godly are ready to exceed, upon the one Hand, in the uſe of their lawful Comforts, and ſo have need of a Bridle to keep them from going beyond the bounds of Sobriety and Moderation <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. So are they prone upon the other Hand to deny themſelves the benefit of theſe things which the Lord's Bounty doth allow upon them, either thrô exceſs of Grief and Fear, or misbelieving Apprehenſions that nothing is allowed upon them, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 107.18. or from Scruples of Conſcience, ariſing from their ignorance of their Chriſtian Liberty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2. &amp;c. ſo that they have need of a Spurr to make them uſe with Freedom and Cheerfulneſs of Spirit, their allowance of outward Comforts: therefore doth the Spirit of the Lord excite the Godly who are wreſtling thrô the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Life, to take cheerfully their allowed Comforts by
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:51442:242"/>
this Exhortation, <hi>Go thy way, eat thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although the beſt performance of the Beſt on Earth be imperfect, and ſo unworthy in it ſelf to be accepted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. yet theſe Performances which are atchieved by a perſon reconciled to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. in obedience to His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. in His Strength, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 71.16. for His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. and have the perfume of Chriſt's Merits u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. theſe are acceptable and wel-pleaſing to Him, as if they were perfect. For ſo much is imported in this Reaſon, <hi>God now accepteth,</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in <hi>thy work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Godly may not only be enabled to do what may be acceptable to God, but they may attain to the knowledge of this, that their Performances are acceptable to Him, while they are elevated beyond the Sphere of their Natural Abilities, and ordinary Temper, to act Holily from ſuch Principles, and for ſuch Ends as were expreſt in the former Doctrine, and have the Lord's Spirit teſtifying his acceptance of their Works by giving them Peace, and Joy in Himſelf. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. For this Reaſon could not have force, except a Godly Man might know that <hi>God accepteth his Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The main thing that makes true Cheerfulneſs in the uſe of common Comforts, is God evidencing His acceptance of our Performances, it is but a poor Comfort that Men accept and approve of our Works, if we have not ground to think that God doth ſo alſo, but if we have this, then we may have much Comfort and Sweetneſs in all our Enjoyments: For he gives this as a Reaſon why Man ſhould eat his Bread with Joy, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p n="7">7.

every day, Pſ.</hi> 7.11. and that even their beſt Works are an <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> to him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. For this is given as a ground of that cheerful uſe of the Creatures which is peculiar to the Godly, <hi>God now accepteth thy works.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. Though prodigality in Apparel, manifeſted in Mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſtrange Faſhions, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.8 and beſtowing exceſſive coſt and pains upon it, be a Sin deteſtable to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. yet it is not only ſutable for Chriſtians, but it is their duty <hi>To provide for things honest in the ſight of all Men,</hi> even in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Apparel, ſo far as their Rank, and the Lord's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations with them permit; they who have the ſhame of their Nakedneſs covered with the white Linnen of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and their Souls adorned with His Grace, may with greateſt freedom and peace put on their outward Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may wear the ſame with cheerfulneſs, how courſe and mean ſoever it be: For to thoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks, <hi>Let thy Garments be always white.</hi>

Although the Lord's People in ſome caſes, as in times of Perſecution, or when their Corruptions are like to prevail againſt them, are bound to keep their Bodies in ſubjection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. yet when the Lord is more favourable to them, and he is teſtifying his acceptance of their Works, they ought to ſignifie their Joy and Cheerfulneſs by their reſpect to their outward Man, in ſuch a manner as is decent and uſual in the places where they live. For it is mainly in reference to times of favourable Diſpenſations, and when <hi>God decepts the works</hi> of his People, that <hi>Solomon</hi> preſſeth here a cheerful Deportment, which is a Moral Duty recommended in ceremonial Terms, ſutable to the cuſtom of the times wherein he lived. <hi>Let thy Head lack no Oyntment.</hi>

Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> here preſſes upon the Husband, that which is alſo proportionally the Duty of the Wife, <hi>Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou loveſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Love of the Husband to the Wife, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of her to him, is ſo ſutable to the Light of Nature, and ſo expreſly commanded in the Word of God, that there ſhould not be great need to preſs it much upon any Chriſtian, that hath any thing of the Knowledge or Fear of God: For <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here ſuppoſes, and takes for granted, that <hi>Love</hi> is not wanting, only he preſſes the effect or proof of it, cheerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing together, <hi>Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou loveſt,</hi>

                  <p>THe Preacher giveth here a ſecond Direction for making the Life of the Godly comfortable unto them, and for
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:51442:244"/>
their right improving of the Comforts of it mentioned in the former, namely, that Men ſhould vigourouſly proſecute the duties of their Calling in the due ſeaſon thereof, <hi>Whatſoever thy Hand finds to do,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do is with thy might.</hi> He doth not hereby proclaim Licence to Men to do any thing that is in their power, ſeing Men have often power and opportunity to act the greateſt Impieties, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.1. But the meaning is, that the outmoſt of that Ability which God gives, eſpecially the ſtrength and comfort which is received by the uſe of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, ſhould be put forth in the vigorous going about of the Duties of our particular Stations, in the ſeaſon and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof. And this he preſſeth by a Reaſon, <hi>For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave.</hi> &amp;c. which is not to be underſtood as if there were an end of Men at Death, as there is of the Beaſts, but the meaning is, that in the ſtate of ſeparation of the Soul from the Body, there is no ploting, nor acting for the Honour of God, or promoving of our own Happineſs, as now there is: And ſeing every Man is <hi>Posting</hi> (as the laſt Word in the Verſe ſignifies) toward that State, therefore he ſhould improve all his Strength, and the Comforts of this Life, for incouragement in his Duty.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. The Lord's Liberality to Man, manifeſted in the variety of the outward Comforts of this Life, ſhould be improven for making him ſerious and diligent in the duties of his Calling, watching every opportunity thereof, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all the ſtrength and cheerfulneſs of Spirit, which he hath acquired by the good things of God, in doing him Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, elſe <hi>his Table is a Snare</hi> to him, and his Comforts are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Curſes: For this is inferred upon the former large Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of God, which he preſt Men to make uſe of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <hi>Whatſoever thy Hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men have often both opportunity and power of doing Good, which they thrô neglect and careleſneſs are ready to let ſlip, which is a very bad return to God for his Liberality:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:51442:245"/>
Therefore the Spirit of God finds it neceſſary to ſtirr Men up to take hold of every opportunity of Duty, as a proof of their thankfulneſs to God for his Bounty, <hi>Whatſoever thy Hand finds to do, do it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The outmoſt of our Ability is to be ſhewn in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of every commanded Duty, conſidering what is the hazard of negligent doing the Work of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.10. and that the more Fervent, Serious and Vigorous we are in walking in the Ways of the Lord, the more our Strength will grow, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10, 29. Therefore (ſaith he) <hi>Do it with thy might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the opportunity of theſe Duties whereby we Honour God, and promove our own and others Salvation, is confined within the bounds of this Life; ſo the conſideration hereof ſhould make Men ſharpen their Wit in Ploting ways of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and doing good to their own Souls and others, and put forth the outmoſt of their Abilities for theſe Ends: For he gives this as a Reaſon of Mens ſeriouſneſs and diligence in their Duty, while they have opportunity. That, <hi>There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor Wiſdom in the Grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every Man is in a continual Journey towards his long Home, whether he walk or reſt, he is ſtill <hi>Posting</hi> thither, and ſhould ſo look upon himſelf, and thereby be moved to imploy his time and ſtrength to the outmoſt, in Honouring God, and working out his own Salvation in Fear and Trembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For ſo he ſpeaks of every Man, as in a conſtant motion toward his Grave, <hi>There is no work, nor device,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Grave;</hi> whither thou <hi>goeſt,</hi> or (as the Word may be Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) whither thou <hi>haſteth.</hi>

                  <p>LEſt Men may preſume too much of Succeſs in theſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which they ſet about <hi>with all their might,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction in the former verſe, and meeting with diſappointment may be the more vexed; The Preacher doth in the <hi>Third</hi> place teach us humbly to depend upon God for ſucceſs, and to deny our own Abilities and preparations, which ſeem to promiſe it to us.</p>
                  <p>And this he ſets out <hi>First,</hi> by ſhewing how ſerious he was in the Obſervation of diſappointments frequent among Men, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and ſaw under the Sun,</hi> He ſpeaks of the motion of his mind in terms borrowed from the motions of the Body, he drew his thoughts a little from other conſiderations formerly mentioned, and applied them to the frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments which men meet with in the carriage of their Affaires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He giveth five inſtances of theſe diſappointments which he had obſerved befalling men beſt fitted for ſucceſs, which inſtances though they have a truth very remarkable in themſelves, yet they are only to be looked upon as ſerving to lead us to all other things of that ſort, that by theſe moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtances of mens diſappointments in their civil and common Affairs, we may be led to the truth he is upon as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in things of a higher concernment, more immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Salvation of mens Souls, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of while he ſaith, <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> Rom. 9.16. And again, <hi>neither is he that planteth, any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7. nor are theſe inſtances to be taken as if the Race were <hi>Never</hi> to the ſwift, nor the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:51442:246"/>
at any time to the ſtrong <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeing experince ſhews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and Scripture alſo, <hi>John</hi> 20, 4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. but the meaning is, that there are frequent proofs of theſe, that men with moſt promiſing qualifications fall ſhort of deſired ſucceſs, yea even of things neceſſary for the ſuſtenance of their natural life, ſo that often their witt cannot ſo much as get them bread, that ſo they may be taught Dependence upon a Superiour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling providence, which muſt concurr with a Bleſſing, elſe their greateſt endeavours, and promiſing appearances of ſucceſs, will fall ſhort of the deſired and intended effect.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He gives a twofold cauſe of theſe diſappointments. The <hi>One</hi> is <hi>without</hi> Man, to wit, the ſecret powerful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, For (ſaith he) <hi>time and chance happeneth to them all,</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> here ſpoken of is the fitteſt opportunity for Mens Actions, which is fixed as the word ſignifies, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and foreknowledge of God. And that which is called <hi>Chance</hi> happening to men, is not be taken as if any thing fell out which is not foreſeen and foreordained by the Lord, but he ſpeaks of theſe occurrences of providence which (as the word tranſlated elſewhere 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.4) touch men, or <hi>Beat</hi> upon them (as the word ſignifies) and ſo may mind them of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hand overruling them, and their actions: Now this as a cauſe of diſappointment is not to be underſtood as if men were therefore diſappointed, becauſe God hath predetermined events and the time of them, but becauſe Men do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and humbly depend upon him who hath fixed all Events and the ſeaſons of them, that they might know their Duty, and the ſeaſon thereof, as the following words make clear, therefore they are diſappointed. The <hi>Second</hi> Cauſe is <hi>within</hi> Man, and that is his ignorance of the fit ſeaſon of his acting which he might know by conſulting the word and Spirit of God, but he neglecting this, fights and runs, and Enterpriſes many things out of the due ſeaſon, and ſo finds no ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He doth illuſtrat the ſad conſequences of men not
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:51442:246"/>
conſidering the time, and not depending upon God in their Actings, by two ſimilituds, of Birds and Fiſhes, whoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity eaſily inſnares them, and applyes the ſame to men who are ſurprized by ſad occurrences of providence, for want of humble dependence upon God, and for acting out of the due ſeaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p>From this purpoſe we may Learn, 1. Experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not attained but by frequent and ſerious obſerving of the various Events that fall out under the Sun, and conſidering of the cauſes and conſequences of them: For ſo did <hi>Solomon</hi> attain to this knowledge. <hi>I returned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſaw under the Sun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When Men have their hearts applyed to their work and have qualifications for it, which may probably produce the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect, they are then very apt to forget dependence upon God, to promiſe to themſelves certain ſucceſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and never to look higher than ſecond Cauſes, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and means which they have: For having exhorted in the former words to follow duty vigorouſly, he meets here with men who having done ſo as they think, are promiſing ſucceſs to themſelves without dependence upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and ſees it fitting to mind them that they may look for diſappointment, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men may be qualified with theſe things that are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing of ſucceſs, and may imploy all their ſtrength for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and yet be diſappointed, while the Lord withholds his aſſiſtance, to correct them for want of Dependence upon, and acknowledgement of him, and to convince them that their ways are not in their own hand: For this is it which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith he obſerved, and holds out as uſeful to teach all men Self-denyal in reference to their preparations and qualifications for their undertakings, and humble Dependance upon God for his
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:51442:247"/>
concurrence with them; <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong, nor Bread to the Wiſe.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord exerciſeth men to whom he hath given the beſt qualifications for their undertakings, with variety of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, ſometimes in matters of greater concernment ſometimes in leſſer, he will let them ſee that not only their ſtrength cannot gain the day, or the victory in Battel, but all their wit cannot gain them a morſel of Bread, nor can all their skill gain them any reſpect in the World when his providence doth not favour them, Therefore doth he inſtance many diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and theſe in greater and leſſer matters, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong, nor Bread to the Wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The diſappointments which we obſerve men of greateſt activity and beſt qualification for their undertakings, do meet with, ſhould not weaken the hands of thoſe who have leſs ſtrength, and ſewer qualifications in following their Duty, men ſhould eſteem themſelves ſucceſsful, if they be inabled for their Duty, and ſhould comfort themſelves in this, that their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhall be rewarded, though not with preſent ſucceſs, yet with Gods approbation, and reward afterward: For after he hath in the former verſe exhorted men to ſet to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with all their might be it leſs or more, he gives here ſeveral inſtances of ſeveral diſappointments incident to Men who have moſt ſtrength and other qualifications moſt promiſing of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that they who want theſe, which others have had who yet have been diſappointed, may not deſert their duty, but may learn the more humble dependence upon God, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though none have ground to expect ſucceſs, who uſe not the outmoſt of lawful Diligence, and are not in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure qualified for their undertakings, yet often it falls out that theſe who have greateſt ſucceſs are far inferiour to others, for theſe qualifications which ſeem moſt to promiſe the ſame: And this is ſo ordered by the Lord that none of his people may deſert
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:51442:247"/>
any duty he calls them to, how ſmall appearance of ſucceſs ſo ever they have, the Slow muſt run the Race that he hath ſet before them, and the Weak muſt to the warefare which he calls them to, in hope of ſucceſs, though they be not qualified as they ought; For while he ſaith, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong,</hi> &amp;c. He doth import, that the Race is ſometimes to the <hi>Slow,</hi> and the victory to the <hi>Weak</hi> &amp;c. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they follow Duty honeſtly, and with all their might according to the former direction.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſucceſs of Mens Enterprizes is not to be attributed to the qualifications that fit them for theſe, but to the favourable concurrence of divine Providence: For therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> doth inſtance the diſappointments of thoſe who have had the beſt qualifications, that when the Swift get the Race, and the Strong carry the day in Battel <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They may attribute their ſucceſs to divine concurrence, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Lord hath all Events carved out, and the very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute wherein they are to fall out, fixed in his eternal decree, and no mans power or wit, can alter any of theſe, For (ſaith he) <hi>Time and Chance</hi> (whereby are meant all Events, and the Minute of their falling out) <hi>happen to them all,</hi> or, as the word is, <hi>touches them all,</hi> namely as he hath <hi>Foreordained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The conſideration of a providence <hi>predetermining</hi> what ſhall be, and in what ſeaſon, ſhould not marr us in our Duty, but teach us humble Dependence upon, and acknowledgment of him who hath all in his hand, without which not only are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments frequent, but in diſpleaſure alſo, for this is a reaſon of mans diſappointment, not ſimply (as was explained before) but becauſe he doth not depend upon and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God, who would either time his indeavours, ſo as they ſhould tryſt with his time ſet for ſucceſs, or otherwiſe would ſanctify the diſappointments which he hath appointed him to meet with, <hi>Time and Chance happeneth to all, Man alſo knows not his time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:51442:248"/>10. Beſide the qualifications which are fitting for attaining to ſuch and ſuch effects, as Swiftneſs for the Race, and Strength for the war, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is alſo neceſſary a right diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the opportunity fit for theſe undertakings, which by the ſanctified Exerciſe of humane prudence, following the general rules of the word, may be in ſuch meaſure attained to as men may have peace, and confidence of acceptation: And it is mens not ſtudying to know theſe times even ſo far as they may be known which is often the cauſe of their Diſappointment, and running themſelves in many Snares: For it is here given as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of theſe Diſappointments formerly mentioned, and of the Snares and Inconveniencies ſpoken of afterward, <hi>Man alſo knows not his time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Even thoſe who have all other Advantages for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Succeſs, if they want humble dependence upon God's Providence, and do not ſeek, his Direction to Time their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons right, they cannot but expect to be ſurprized with Snares, ſeing they conſider not that there is a Supreme Providence over them, as the Birds and Fiſhes conſider not that there is a wiſer Creature than themſelves to enſnare them, they are often moſt ſecure when the Hazard is neareſt, as the Birds or Fiſhes are, and have greateſt hopes of Satisfaction, when they are neareſt their own ruine, and being taken in the Snare by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, are held the faſter the more they wreſtle to get out, till they learn to acknowledge and ſubmit to the Lord. For ſo much is imported in theſe Similitudes, <hi>As the Fiſhes that are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds that are in the Snares, ſo are the Sons of Men enſnared in an evil Time, when it cometh ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Men that walk not with dependence upon God, laying their account for all Hazards and Trials, wherewith they may be exerciſed, and reſolving to ſubmit to all Inconveniencies, are ſtill ſurprized with all their Croſſes; And times of Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment which prove good to the Godly, prove evil Times
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:51442:248"/>
to them, <hi>So are the Sons of Men ſnared in an evil Time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He doth in this ſame ſuppoſed Hiſtory hold forth, the Intertainment that the truly Wiſe may expect in the World though they ſhould be inſtrumental in bringing about the greateſt outward Mercies to worldly Men, and that is to be ſlighted. <hi>And no Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Remembred the poor Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He doth hence draw Two uſeful Concluſions. 1. That <hi>Wiſdom is better than Strength,</hi> that is, it is ſometimes more bleſt for bringing about even outward Deliverance, when external Strength is wanting, than all the Strength in the World without this Wiſdom. 2. That if Men want other external things to recommend them to the World, they may reſolve to be ſlighted, and have their inward Qualifications, ſuch as Wiſdom, miſregarded by the moſt part of Men.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. The uſefulneſs and excellency of that Wiſdom which is from Above, is not only to be ſeen by the Reading and Hearing of the Word, but alſo by the obſervation of the Effects
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51442:249"/>
which the ſame is bleſt to produce, both to them that are indued with it, and to others, eſpecially the comfortable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which comes by it under Straits, and the ſweet way of eſcape and outgate, even when Men want probable outward means of Safety and Delivery: For it is this experimental ſight of the excellency of this Wiſdom in the effect of it, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks, while he ſaith, <hi>This Wiſdom have I ſeen alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The greater meaſure of true Wiſdom any have, the greater eſteem they have of it, not only in themſelves but in others, and even in theſe who are poor and mean, and having no other thing in the World to commend them, they magnify the appearances and effects of it where ever they ſee them: For <hi>Solomon</hi> who had a great meaſure of it prized it highly, even in a poor Man, <hi>This Wiſdom have I ſeen under the Sun, and it ſeemed great to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where the Lord intends Delivery, he doth ſometimes in the depth of his Wiſdom, ſuffer ſuch Straits to come, as Ruine ſeems near and unavoidable, that men may learn to deny their own Wit and Power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. and may eſteem the more of a Delivery when it is brought about. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126.1. &amp;c. For here in this ſuppoſed Hiſtory or Parable, <hi>There was a little City and few Men within it, and there came a great King and beſeiged it, and built great Bulwarks againſt it,</hi> whereby the Ruine of it was apparent, and yet Deliverance is a preparing, and working for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe who have no external means of Defence or Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very equal to the power imployed againſt them, ought not to deſpair of a Delivery, nor think it impoſſible, but ſtill leave room to God to find out the way, though they do not ſee it; Neither ought thoſe whoſe external force and power do far exceed their Adverſaries, and have improven the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, even to the almoſt gaining of their point, promiſe certain ſucceſs to themſelves: For here <hi>The little City and few Men are preſerved,</hi> and the <hi>Great King</hi> who <hi>raiſed great Bulwarks againſt it, hath not the deſired ſucceſs:</hi> For <hi>the City is delivered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:51442:250"/>5. The Lord doth often beſtow the moſt excellent Gifts of the Mind, upon thoſe who have leaſt of outward Gifts, ſuch as Riches, Honour, and the like, that all may know he doth not value theſe outward Qualifications, as he doth the inward, which the World undervalueth, and that theſe inward Gifts may be ſeen to be his, and freely beſtowed, when they are given to perſons who have ſo little of outward things that might help or encourage in the acquiring of them: For here in this City, <hi>There was found a poor Wiſe Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the Lord doth ſometimes make the riſe of a Peoples Delivery to be from that Airth whence they leaſt expected it; ſo when he intends a Delivery to a Community where he hath ſome of his own, he doth ordinarily make ſome of thoſe inſtrumental in the bringing of it about, either by moving them to Pray for it, and ſo giving it in anſwer to their Prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3. &amp;c. or by ſuggeſting to them the beſt Courſe for it, and bleſſing their Endeavours for obtaining of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.22. So that it ſhould be thought a great Advantage to have but one truly Godly Perſon in a Society, ſeing where any ſuch are, if a Delivery be poſſible, the Lord rather Honours them than others, to be inſtumental in bringing it about: For here <hi>The poor Man by his Wiſdom delivered the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Although the truly Godly be often little obliged to thoſe they live among, for any reſpect or encouragement they have from them, yet is it their Duty, and it is alſo their Diſpoſition, to imploy any Witt they have for the good of thoſe among whom they are, for preventing their ruine, that they may have time to Repent and reform their Ways: For this <hi>Poor Wiſe Man</hi> hath had little incouragement from his fellow Citizens, as appears by what is ſpoken of their After-carriage to him in this ſuppoſed Hiſtory, and yet he imploys his Witt for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Delivery to them, <hi>The poor Man by his Wiſdom deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:51442:250"/>8. So little do worldly Men diſcern the Beauty of God's Grace in his People, ſo highly do they eſteem of outward things, Riches, Honour, and the like, and ſo great is their enmity againſt the Godly, that though they have taſted of the ſweet Fruits of their Wiſdom and other Perfections, they cannot but ſlight them, and the Godly muſt reſolve for ſuch a Lot, and learn to draw their incouragement from the Lord's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them for following of their Duty; For he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns here, that if a Godly Man do a good Turn to the ingrate World, he will readily get little Thanks for his pains, <hi>No Man remembred the poor Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is not enough to remark the Paſſages of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which we behold, but we ought to learn ſomething from them that may be of general uſe to our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to take opportunity according to our Calling, to communicat the ſame to others for their Good: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here Comment upon the preſent Paſſage ſet forth in this Parable, and draws Concluſions from it for the uſe of the Church, <hi>Then ſaid I, Wiſdom is better than Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Thoſe who are indued with true Wiſdom to know the Mind of God from his Word, and a right Carriage under Straits, though deprived of outward Means of Defence or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from Straits, are in a much more deſirable Condition, than thoſe who have never ſo much external Strength without that Wiſdom: For they who have outward Strength without this Wiſdom, cannot but truſt in it, and ſo provoke the Lord either to Blaſt it, and make it ineffectual as to the obtaining of Delivery, or if they do obtain it, it be in Wrath to them, while as they who have this Wiſdom without that ſtrength, are thereby led to make uſe of the Strength of the Lord which is engaged to do for them in Straits, they are thereby kept from ſinful Courſes for Delivery, and made to ſubmit to Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if God ſee it fit to exerciſe them therewith: For though this Commendation of Wiſdom may be true of common
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:51442:251"/>
Humane Prudence, which ſometimes proves better than never ſo much outward ſtrength without it, yet it is ſafeſt to take it for a Commendation of the exerciſe of ſanctified Reaſon, which is nothing elſe but Saving Knowledge, applied (it may be) to the common matters of this Life, <hi>Wiſdom is better than Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. As it is a high Provocation of the Lord to look no higher than the Inſtruments of our Delivery, and to put them in God's place, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.13. So it is no leſs a Provocation to ſlight Inſtruments, and not (for his ſake) to honour and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Perſon whom he honours to do us good, or to deſpiſe God's Gifts in them, becauſe they want outward Gifts: For in te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>mony of the Lord's taking notice of their ſlighting the poor Man and his Wiſdom, it is twice ſet down, once in the Hiſtory, and again in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Obſervations upon it, <hi>No Man remembred the poor Man, and the poor Mans Wiſdom is deſpiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. That which makes the wholeſome Counſel and Advice of the Godly to be ſlighted by the Men of this World, is, their undervaluing of their Perſons, ſo as they give not a hearing to their words: If the worth and utility of what even ſome of the poorer ſort of them may hold out, were pondered, their Gifts would make way for them: For the latter Clauſe may be looked upon as the cauſe of the former, <hi>The poor Mans Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is deſpiſed,</hi> why? <hi>his words are not heard.</hi>

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:51442:251"/>
for the good of others, by ſhewing that ſucceſs will not be always wanting, <hi>The words of the Wiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are heard in quiet,</hi> which may be underſtood 1. As pointing at the Lot of the Godly, who would communicat the truth to others, they muſt often deliver the ſame very quietly, they will not always get ſo publick a Hearing as the Truth deſerves, by reaſon of the corruption of Times, and wicked Humours of People. 2. It may be taken as holding out the qualification of them that would do good to others, and get a Hearing to the Truth; they muſt in a ſober and calm manner, without Clamour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or Oſtentation deliver it, and ſo God will get it a hearing with ſome. 3. It may be taken for a deſcription of the right diſpoſition of Hearers of the Truth, they muſt be of Quiet, Calm, Humble and Meek Spirits. Becauſe theſe do all agree, and the Speech is indefinit, it may be looked upon as comprehending them all, holding this in the general, that it is an encouragement to the Wiſe to communicat their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by promiſing ſucceſs to them; for the Hebrews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Promiſe by way of Enunciation in the preſent time: And this Promiſe of Succeſs he illuſtrates, by comparing the ſame with that Succeſs which other Mens words have, even ſuppoſe them to be Rulers, while he ſaith, <hi>More than the Cry of him that ruleth among Fools,</hi> the oppoſition ſhews that the Ruler here ſpoken of is to be looked upon as deſtitute of this Saving Wiſdom, and ſo like his fooliſh Subjects among whom he Rules: So the meaning ſeems to be, that the Truth of God, or the meek Counſels of the Godly, however deſpiſed by the moſt part of Men, ſhall gain acceptance with peaceable and humble Souls, even when he ſame may not be avowed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, more than the moſt publick Edicts of wicked Rulers ſhall have with the generality of their fooliſh Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> That all may be moved to entertain the Counſel or Advice of the truly Wiſe, be they never ſo poor and mean in the World, he doth again commend Heavenly Wiſdom, as
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:51442:252"/>
more uſeful, eſpecially in a Strait, to which the former ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Hiſtory relates, than all external means of Defence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: He did before preferr it to Strength, now to the Means or <hi>Instruments of War,</hi> which Strength makes uſe of, in ſo far as it teaches Men to depend upon God and make uſe of his Strength: and this he illuſtrates by pointing out the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which <hi>one Sinner,</hi> or a few (for <hi>one</hi> is ſometimes put for <hi>a few</hi>) may bring to the whole Society where they are tolerat, as he ſhewed before, that one poor Wiſe Man, by whom is meant a Godly Man, delivered the City: So here that <hi>one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> by whom is meant (as is clear by the oppoſition) any one deſtitute of Saving Knowledge, and a Ring-leader in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may marr the Delivery of a whole Society from danger, and conſequently bring Ruine upon it, eſpecially when ſuch an one is Countenanced and Preferred: And this is alſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the oppoſition of this one Sinner to the <hi>Poor Wiſe Man,</hi> who was Deſpiſed, Slighted, and his Words not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>From this we may Learn 1. When the Truth of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get a publick Hearing in the World, the Lord will get acceptance to it, and will be doing good by it in private Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo will be ſtill propagating his Truth, as he did by his Apoſtles and Prophets in evil Times, when they might not avow themſelves; in which ſenſe this general Speech is verified, <hi>The words of the Wiſe are heard in quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not a clamorous, hot, and violent way of preſſing even Truth it ſelf, that will gain Acceptance to it, nor will that way be ſtudied by them that are truly Wiſe, and deſire to ſpread the Truth, but rather it is that quiet and calm way of delivering of it, which Chriſt himſelf uſed, who did not ſtrive nor cry, nor cauſe his Voice to be heard in the Streets, that prevails moſt: The Lord will have it ſo, that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and fruit of ſpeaking the Truth, may be ſeen to be his ſecret power with it, and the Beauty and Equity of the thing
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:51442:252"/>
ſpoken, rather than any thing it hath from the Speaker: For ſo may this alſo be taken, as pointing out the qualification ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the right way of delivering the Truth, <hi>The words of the Wiſe are heard in quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe who are of Compoſed, Meek and Humble Spirits, ready to ſubmit to the Mind of God, when it is held forth, and not to gain-ſay it in their Hearts, when it ſpeaks moſt ſharpely againſt their Corruptions, thoſe are fit to receive the Truth of God, ſuch will hear it and profit by it, when others deny it a Hearing, and will take well with a ſavoury Counſel and Advice from others, were they never ſo poor and mean: For having ſaid before, that the poor Man's words were deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and not heard, to wit by the moſt part of Men, he adds this, that notwithſtanding, <hi>The words of the Wiſe are heard in quiet,</hi> namely by Quiet, Calm and Submiſſive Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Men that have Rule over others do not hear the Truth of God themſelves, though ſpoken by the pooreſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Servants of his, and do not imploy their power to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the knowledge of it, and gain reſpect to it among their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but ſuffer them to remain ignorant of God, and ſo Fools indeed for any care or pains they take to make them wiſe, it is but juſt with God to make their moſt imperious and publick Commands have little reſpect with their Subjects, and leſs than they give to his Counſel coming from his deſpiſed Meſſengers, yea to raiſe up ſome to ſpeak againſt their wicked Edicts at leaſt in <hi>Quiet,</hi> when his Truth may not be avowed, and make thoſe to be better heard than wicked Rulers are: And ſo verify this, <hi>That the words of the Wiſe are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that Ruleth among Fools.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

in caſe of former Miſttakes or Negligence) for Direction how to carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, both in ſpeech and practice, and give both God and them their due, which only can be attained by that Wiſdom which is from Above, and shines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in the Word of God. <hi>ver. 10.</hi> The neceſſity of which Wiſdom for this end he evidenceth, <hi>1.</hi> From the evil and danger of railing and reproachful Speeches, incident to Men deſtitute of ſaving Wiſdom, againſt incenſed and corrupt Rulers when they meet with any violence or diſappointment of their ambitious Ends from them, they thereby readily procuring their own Ruine (as a Serpent by his audible hiſſing doth his killing) from thoſe whom by his detracting Speeches he provokes. <hi>ver. 11. 2.</hi> From the advantage of having this heavenly Wiſdom, which directeth a Man to the uſe of ſuch ſavoury Words and Expreſſions, as conciliats the favour of offended Rulers. <hi>ver. 12. 3.</hi> From the ſad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effects of ſuch rash and detracting Speeches towards theſe in Authority, as proving the Mean of a Mans inſnaring and deſtroying himſelf. <hi>ver. 12. 4.</hi> From the height and extremity that ſuch hard Speeches do ordinarly run to, that as they begin with, and flow from Levity and Inconſtancy, ſo they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat in mad and furious Courſes againſt theſe Rulers. <hi>ver. 13.</hi> And <hi>5.</hi> From the deſcription of ſuch Men deſtitute of this ſaving Knowledge of God, and their Duty to them in Authority, by reſembling them unto the Natural Fools of the World in the multiplying of Words, by boaſting of their intended Actions, and inquiring into, and determining future Events. <hi>ver. 14.</hi> And in the vanity and fruitleſneſs of their Endeavours, even in common and very ordinary Affairs. <hi>ver. 15.</hi> And upon the mentioning of the Grievances of the Godly, under the bad Government of corrupt Rulers, and their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, Notwithstanding thereof, The Preacher takes occaſion, <hi>1.</hi> To shew the miſery of that Land who have voluptuous and unqualified Rulers, both Supreme and Inferior ſet over them. <hi>ver. 16. 2.</hi> The happineſs of that Nation or People, over whom eminently qualified and ſober Governours are ſet. <hi>ver. 17.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> The Cauſe or Root of that Ruine that comes upon a Land underwicked and inſufficient Rulers, to be their exceeding Sloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Careleſneſs (as a Man that ſuffereth his Houſe to decay through neglect to repair it) in uſing fit Means to ſave the State from Ruine and Deſtruction, <hi>ver. 18.</hi> And their Luxury and exceſſive and unſeaſonable Uſe of worldly Enjoyments, to the enhauncing of Money to ſpend upon their Luſts, and impoverishing of their Subjects. <hi>ver. 19.</hi> The <hi>III.</hi> and laſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is, That notwithſtanding People may meet with many Grievances from vitious and inſufficient Rulers, apt to stirr the paſſions even of the Beſt; yet they ought to forbear all bitterneſs of Spirit, and revengeful Imprecations of Vengeance upon them, and to entertain no malitious Thoughts againſt their Perſons or Authority. <hi>ver. 20.</hi> which be preſſeth by an Argument taken from the ſudden and unexpected Diſcovery of this, either in time, to the confuſion and punishment of the Offender, or hereafter before Angels and Men, to their eternal Shame and Deſtruction. <hi>ver. 20.</hi>

                     <hi>SOlomon</hi> having at large commended ſaving knowledge or Chriſtian prudence, he doth now preſs the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſhew how it ſhould be manifeſted in a Chriſtians Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and before he give directions for this end, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prepare the heart for receiving of them, by inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who have gained eſteem in the minds of others for Wiſdom, or any other gift they have therewith, ſuch as <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Eloquence</hi> (as the word tranſlated <hi>Honour</hi> ſignifies) that they had great need to be very accurat and circumſpect in their walking: And this he doth by repreſenting the hazard of the miſcarriage of ſuch, though it were but in ſome ſmall point of raſhneſs or inconſideration which he calls <hi>a litle Folly,</hi> manifeſted by them and marked by others in their carriage, this will render them altogether uſeleſs, for doing good to others and make all the reſt of their carriage unſavoury: And this hazard he illuſtrats by a ſimilitude well known to the people among whom he lived, of <hi>a dead Flie,</hi> which falling into the <hi>Oyntment</hi> of the Apothecary, doth readily putrify the ſame and make it uſeleſs and unſavoury. So the verſe may be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for an Argument to ſtudy the conſtant exerciſe and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of Heavenly Wiſdom in the converſation, becauſe even a ſmall miſcarriage in them that are eſteemed truly wiſe, will make them very unſavoury,</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Though it be the ordinary lot of thoſe who are truely Wiſe and Godly to be in a mean obſcure and deſpiſ'd condition in the World, as he had ſhewn toward the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:51442:255"/>
cloſe of the former Chapter, yet it is not always ſo with all of them, for ſometimes the Lord gives them with ſaving Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuch other things as uſe to be moſt in eſteem with the World, that they may thereby be the fitter for promoving his Honour. And as he favours them himſelf, ſo ſometimes he gains them favour and Reputation with men, yea even the worſt of men <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. So much doth <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuppoſe here, for there is no ground to think that he ſpeaks of ſuch as have only an undeſerved <hi>Reputation,</hi> but of ſuch as have and deſerve to have <hi>Reputation for Wiſdom and Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more eſteem and Reputation eſpecially for Wiſdom any have among Men, the greater hazard are they in to bewray their folly and raſhneſs, either by being lifted up above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. by deſpiſing others <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.24. or upon the conceit of their own eminency in that or any other perfection waxing preſumptuous and fearleſs of their own miſcarriage <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.33.69. And ſo have often greater need to be warned of their hazard to miſcarry, than theſe who are in leſs eſteem for Wiſdom: For the Spirit of God directed <hi>Solomon</hi> in the cloſe of the former Chapter to commend and incourage the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Wiſe man, but here he directs him to guard the Wiſe man who hath Reputation and Honour, by inſinuating his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to Miſcarry, while he ſaith, <hi>Dead Flies cauſe the Oyntment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking favour; ſo doth a little folly him that is in Reputation for Wiſdom and Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As thoſe that deſerve Reputation and eſteem from others ought not ambitiouſly to hunt after it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. nor be much moved when they want it. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.3. So their having of it ſhould make them the more exact in their walk and cautious leſt any thing eſcape them that may make their name unſavoury: They ſhould make their eſteem and Reputation among men an Argument to move their own hearts to ſtudy Accuracy and tenderneſs in their behaviour for keeping up their eſteem, that ſo they may be in the fitter capacity to Honour the Lord, and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:51442:255"/>
do good to others. For to ſtir up ſuch to walk ſutable to their eſteem, is this hazard of their miſcarriage, and coming in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace thereby ſet forth to them, as <hi>Dead Flies cauſe the Oyntment</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo doth a little folly</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The greater meaſure of eſteem and Reputation for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and other gifts of God men have attained unto, the more eaſily is their Reputation ſtained even by the ſmalleſt miſcarriage diſcernable in them. They have the eyes of Envy fixt upon them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9. thoſe who have been ſilenced by their blameleſs behaviour, will readily ſpeak much againſt them, when they manifeſt but a little Folly 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. And the more ſtraight their former carriage hath been the more remarkable will the leaſt impertinency or raſhneſs in their future carriage be, as a ſmall blemiſh is eaſily diſcerned in a face that hath always appeared beautiful. The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof ſhould ſtir up ſuch to walk the more circumſpectly; whereunto <hi>Solomon</hi> here by this Argument doth excite them, <hi>a little Folly makes them unſavoury</hi> and uſeleſs <hi>who have been in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for Wiſdom and Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. So ſpiritual ſhould the minds of Chriſtians be, eſpecially the Lords publick Servants, that they ſhould make ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of theſe things which are of moſt common uſe among men, and ſo ſhould be ready to illuſtrate and commend truth and duty to others, by theſe things which may be their daily remembrancers. For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here, <hi>Dead Flies cauſe the Oyntment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a stinking ſavour, ſo doth a little.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the untainted Reputation of a Wiſe Chriſtian makes him very ſavoury, and his carriage and Counſels wholeſome and medicinal to others with whom he converſes, while he makes manifeſt the ſavour of the knowledge of Chriſt, and by his example and inſtruction heals the diſtempers of thoſe among whom he lives; So the miſcarriage of ſuch a man makes him ſo much the more noiſome and unſavoury, as he hath been
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:51442:256"/>
before ſavoury and uſeful, as is imported in this ſimilitude and the application of it. There is nothing more wholeſome and ſavoury than pretious Oyntment, while it is freſh, nothing leſs uſeful and more unſavoury, when it is corrupt. And ſo is it with thoſe that have been <hi>in Reputation for Wiſdom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> While by their holy and circumſpect walking, they keep their Reputation, they are very ſavoury and uſeful, but when even by <hi>a little Folly,</hi> and much more by their groſs failings, they loſe it, they become very noiſome and unſavoury.</p>

The man that hath ſaving Wiſdom, his mind is preſent at his duty and fit to direct him how to go dexterouſly about it, in the opportunity thereof: And this he expreſſeth in a proverbial kind of ſpeech, <hi>his Heart is at his right hand,</hi> becauſe it is with the <hi>Right</hi> hand that Men ordinarily are readieſt and ſwifteſt in working.

                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:51442:256"/>Next, He gives a deſcription of the man deſtitut of this Heavenly Wiſdom in two Branches, The <hi>First</hi> is, That he is unfit for every duty, <hi>his Heart is at his left Hand,</hi> he cannot go dexterouſly about his actions, and hath no Heart to act any thing aright. The <hi>Second,</hi> That he doth palpably diſcover his naughtineſs to diſcerning Onlookers by his viſible deportment <hi>when he walks by the way,</hi> that is, when he is about any duty Common or Religious, <hi>his Wiſdom,</hi> or (as it is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) his Heart <hi>fails him,</hi> he hath neither Wiſdom, Strength nor Courage for his Duty, eſpecially when he meets with difficulties in the way of it, <hi>and he ſaith to every one that he is a Fool,</hi> not as if he did in words expreſs ſo much: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks nothing in this Book of natural Fools, or ſuch as are deſtitut of the exerciſe of common Reaſon, but of perſons void of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, how wiſe ſoever they ſeem to be otherwiſe, they are often left of God to bewray their Folly to ſpritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerners.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. In ſo far as Chriſtians are indued with Heavenly Wiſdom, and do improve the ſame, they will do nothing before they deliberat, and conſult the word and Spirit of God concerning their actions both for the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26. that they may diſcover and foreſee temptations incident to them in following their Duty, to ſhun them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10.11, and Hazards and inconveniences to eſchew or prepare for them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they will watch the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of their Duty, and keep themſelves in a fit diſpoſition for it, that they be not ſurprized therewith when it offers it ſelf 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7; they will labour to keep theſe conſiderations, which may repel Temptations, &amp; guard againſt diſcouragements <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50, 95. And will be often reflecting upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for matter of Humiliation or Praiſe as they find them right or wrong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. all which may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this deſcription of the truly Godly, <hi>The heart of the Wiſe is at his right hand.</hi>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51442:257"/>2. Men void of the ſaving knowledge and Grace of Chriſt cannot go dexterouſly about any Duty. For either when they purpoſe to do well, the <hi>Right</hi> hand of Execution is abſent from the Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37. Or when they do what is right in it ſelf, their Heart is as it were away from their Hand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13. And ordinarly their Hearts are wholly indiſpoſed for, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from what is their Duty, and only inclined to act what is Siniſtrous or Evil, as is imported in this deſcription of the man void of ſaving Grace or knowledge, <hi>The Heart of the Fool is at his left Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though every mans heart be framed alike, and have the ſame poſition in the Body, yet Saving knowledge, and Grace, make ſo great a change upon the Heart where they are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if the natural ſituation of it were changed. It now in ſome meaſure inclines toward that which is good in the ſight of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, 22. while as before it was only bent toward Evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. For to convince us of the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the regenerat and the unregenerate, he thus deſcribes the one and the other. <hi>The heart of the Wiſe is at his right hand, but the Heart of the Fool is at his left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. However men void of Saving Knowledge and Grace, may hold on for a time in the way that is good and right in it ſelf, eſpecially while they have proſperity, applauſe and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, <hi>John</hi> 5.33. yet when oppoſition and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments become frequent, they loſe all the courage, ſtrength and comfort, which ſometimes they ſeemed to have: For (ſaith he) <hi>when he that is a Fool walks by the way, his Wiſdom</hi> (or as the word is <hi>his Heart) fails him,</hi> the expreſſion is ordinarily uſed of mens deſpondency and diſcouragement of ſpirit, becauſe of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in their way.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As mens carriage and viſible deportment hath a language, which may be heard and underſtood by the truly Wiſe with whom they converſe, ſo however Hypocrites may long carry themſelves ſo cloſely, that they ſhall not bewray their folly or

For this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fool, or the wicked man is not to be underſtood, as if all ſuch did verbally proclaim themſelves to be what they are: But that their unchriſtian and imprudent carriage in oppoſition to the way and will of God, though never ſo much Worldly wit and policy were manifeſted in it, doth often ſpeak to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſe, what they are, <hi>yea alſo when he that is a Fool walks by the way his Wiſdom fails him, and he ſaith to every one that he is a Fool</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> there is the duty injoined to the Godly in theſe words <hi>leave not thy Place,</hi> whereby is not meant that the Godly may not in any caſe flie from the fury of incenſed Rulers: For <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> knew that his Father had ſo done warrantably: But the meaning is that Chriſtians ſhould neither for the apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of great men ſhake off their duty to God, it being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans prime place and ſtation to defend his honour, nor yet

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The favour of great Men is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a very unconſtant thing: And therefore no Man ſhould truſt in it, nor for the obtaining or keeping of it, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the diſpleaſure of him with whom there is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor ſhadow of turning.

                  <p>And this he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> ſet down as obſerved by himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own experience in Nations about him, or among Inferiour Magiſtrates under him, in reference to others of his Subjects, or whether he had this repreſented to him by the Light of the Lord's Spirit, it is all one, he calls it <hi>An Evil,</hi> to wit, an Evil of Sin, upon their part, who ſo abuſe their own power to conferr power upon the Unworthy, and an Evil of Affliction to the Godly, who are born down by that means, and an Evil of Puniſhment to others, who have provoked God to ſet wicked Men over them: And he calls it an Evil <hi>under the Sun,</hi> to point out the Univerſality of it.</p>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:51442:260"/>
this as flowing from the Ignorance, and perverſe Diſpoſition of the Rulers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He giveth two particular Inſtances of this Miſ-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The <hi>One</hi> is, That <hi>Folly is ſet in great dignity:</hi> By <hi>Folly</hi> is meant the fooliſh Man, and according to the Language of the Scripture, eſpecially in this Man's Writtings, the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and wicked Man, whom he calls <hi>Folly</hi> in the abſtract, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting one wicked in the higheſt degree, ſuch a Man, ſaith he, is ſet in <hi>high Dignity,</hi> the Word is plural <hi>Dignities,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the higheſt places of Power and Truſt in the Common-Wealth, or that all ſuch places were ſo diſpoſed of, or that one ſuch extremely wicked perſon had many Offices conferred upon him. The other Inſtance is, That the <hi>Rich ſit in low place:</hi> By the <hi>Rich</hi> cannot be meant one Rich only in things worldly, becauſe the <hi>Fool</hi> might be ſuch, and ſo the oppoſition were not pertinent, neither were it an <hi>Evil</hi> to place ſuch in a low degree, but by the Rich is meant one enriched with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace, eſpecially with Abilities for Government, as the Word is uſed <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.12. And by <hi>ſitting in a low place</hi> is meant, to be out of publick Imployment, and in an abject and deſpiſed Condition. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He inlarges this evil Adminiſtration in two Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, while he ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen Servants upon horſes: and Princes walking,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning whereof is, That he had obſerved Eminent and Honourable Perſons, of Noble and Free Spirits, as <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould be in a Common-wealth, redacted to extreme Miſery for want of publick Imployment, which they deſerve; and <hi>Servants</hi> or Men of baſe ſlaviſh Spirits, fit for no other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than to be at their Command, advanced to Rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Or this Verſe may be looked upon as a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon illuſtrating Miſ-government in the former Inſtances thus, This preferring of the Unworthy, and ſlighting of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, is no leſs unſutable, than if a Prince ſhould page on foot, his Servant riding on a ſtately Horſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:51442:260"/>Hence Learn 1. Thoſe that would prove faithful in any Imployment, eſpecially of truſt and charge over others, ought carefully to mark the Faults of others in the like Imployment; that they may eſchew them themſelves, and may improve their power in their place, for reforming them in others: For here <hi>Solomon</hi> marks the Evils incident to Rulers, and doubtleſs as a Godly King he made the forementioned uſe of this Obſervation, <hi>There is an Evil that I have ſeen under the Sun.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faithful Servants of Chriſt muſt not only diſcover the Errours and Miſcarriages of Inferiours, and common People, but they muſt alſo point out the Faults and Miſcarriages incident to Rulers, and thoſe that are in Power and Authority, and ſometimes publiſh theſe before the Church, leſt people look upon their Faults as no Faults, and that they may be ſtirred up to Mourn for them: For as we may ſafely conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> to make uſe of this Obſervation as a King and Ruler for eſchewing theſe Faults himſelf, which he obſerved common among Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſo may we alſo look upon him as a faithful Preacher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them to the Church, and therein exemplary to other Preachers. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>There is an Evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, as an Errour which proceedeth from the Ruler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though we ought to look up to the Lord, as having a Holy Hand in permitting and ordering wicked Men to have power and preferment, and the Godly to be born down and ſlighted by them, for the puniſhment of Peoples Sins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. The manifeſting of his great power in bringing down wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men from their Eminency, <hi>Ezod,</hi> 9.16. yet whatever we obſerve of that fort in humane Affairs, we muſt ſtill Father the ſame upon Mens Sin and Corruption, as the procuring cauſe that it ſhould be ſo, and as the active Inſtrument making it to be ſo. It is Mens <hi>Errour,</hi> and God is free of it as it is an Errour: For ſo did <hi>Solomon</hi> look upon it as <hi>an Errour proceeding from the Ruler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:51442:261"/>4. Rulers ſhould look upon themſelves as no leſs ſubject to Errours than other Men, and in a ſpecial way ready to manifeſt their Errour, in the matter of diſpoſing places of power and truſt under them, which ſhould make all Men that have power, the more earneſt with God for his Direction in the matter of Intruſting others. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24. For <hi>Solomon</hi> did obſerve this Miſcarriage in State Affairs, <hi>As an Errour proceeding from the Ruler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Although we ought not to excuſe or extenuat the Faults of any, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 5.23. And every one whoſe Calling gives him that liberty, ought to aggredge the Faults of Rulers, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themſelves, for their Conviction and Humiliation. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.7. &amp;c. Yet Chriſtian Charity and Wiſdom dictat, that we ſhould put the faireſt conſtruction we can, upon the Actions of others, eſpecially Rulers and Men in Authority, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how eaſie it is for them to miſcarry, who muſt ſee much of their Work with other Mens Eyes, eſpecially in advancing of perſons to Power and Truſt, ſometimes upon others Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, and ſometimes upon the flattety and hypocritical Pretences of Men themſelves whom they have no ground to diſtruſt: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the Miſ-government of Rulers in the moſt modeſt Terms that he might, as <hi>an Errour</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Ruler.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When wicked Men are advanced to Rule and Eminency among Men, they labour to fill all the places of Power and Truſt under them with ſuch as themſelves, that they may have many to ſerve them in their Luſts, and few to oppoſe or make them aſhamed For it comes from the <hi>Errour of the Ruler,</hi> that <hi>Folly</hi> is ſet in <hi>high dignity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. When wicked Men are advanced to power and place, the godly &amp; they that are enriched with fit Induements for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not only ſlighted, being put out or kept out of Power; but often alſo redacted to great Miſery, oppreſſed &amp; born down: the <hi>Rich</hi> here is one inriched with Gifts, eſpecially Wiſdom, as
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:51442:261"/>
the oppoſition ſhews, <hi>The Rich ſit in a low place,</hi> or as the Word ſignifies, a <hi>deſpicable</hi> and afflicted Condition.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Though the preferring of wicked Men, and bearing down of the Godly, ought to be patiently ſubmitted unto, as it is permitted and ordered by the Lord for wiſe Ends; yet it ought to be reſented as a great Grievance, the Godly ought to be deeply afflicted when they ſee the great Intereſts of Churches or States, put in the Hands of baſe and unworthy Men, who have neither Grace nor Wit to manage them for God's Glory, or the good of others: And they ought to lament, and lay the Caſe before the Lord, who can reform ſuch Abuſes: For ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> regrates it as <hi>an Evil</hi> under the Sun, that the Hearts of the Godly may be affected with it, as his own was, <hi>That Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the Rich in low place,</hi> that <hi>Servants are on Horſes, and Princes walking,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There is ſo much ambition of worldly Greatneſs in the Hearts of the Godly, and ſo litle of the faith of a future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wherein they ſhould comfort themſelves againſt the want of preferment among Men, that the diſcerning of the Miſcarriage of Rulers in diſpoſing of Places and Truſt, is ready to diſcourage them, and to make them weary of their Duty, while they ſee wicked Men preferred, and the Godly ſlighted. Therefore doth the Spirit of God find it neceſſary to diſcover it as the main occaſion of their <hi>leaving of their place,</hi> and deſerting of their Duty, preſt in the former Words, <hi>That Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the Rich in low place,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Worldly Dignity and Preferment is a very uncertain and changeable thing; And therefore no wiſe Men ſhould ſet their Heart upon it, as any part of their Happineſs: they ſhould uſe their place and power well, while they have it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a Change, ſince though they be in <hi>Dignity</hi> to day, they may <hi>ſit in a low place</hi> to morrow, though they be on <hi>Horſe</hi> this day as <hi>Princes,</hi> they may be as <hi>Servants on foot</hi> the next. For ſo had <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved it, and holds it forth to be made uſe

of for promoving his main Scope, the weaning of mens Hearts from purſuing any earthly thing for their Happineſs, <hi>I have ſeen Servants upon horſes, and Princes walking as Servants upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11.

                  <p>Hence Learn 1. Envy and Ambition put Men upon ſuch violent Courſes, that their Minds are hardly brought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either the Evil or Hazard of their way: So that they who deal with ſuch, muſt not in a general and indifferent way ſpeak againſt theſe Luſts, but muſt inſiſt in clearing the nature and hazard of them, inculcating upon Men who are Slaves to them, what they may expect as the iſſue of their way. For ſo doth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here by four ſeveral Similitudes, each one whereof ſpeaks ſomewhat of the evil of theſe Luſts, and repreſents, in a new Notion, the hazard of giving way to them, <hi>He that diggeth a Pit ſhall fall into it, and whoſe breaks an Hedge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

For the Words are expreſt in ſuch general Terms, as they may be applyed both to Magiſtrats interpriſing evil againſt the Godly under them, and to people alſo as diſſwading them from malicious Plots and treaſonable Practices, even againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch as do abuſe their Power, <hi>He that diggs a Pit ſhall fall into it, and whoſo breaks a Hedge a Serpent ſhall bite him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Therefore it is ſafeſt to take this Verſe with reference to the main Scope of the Chapter, which is to commend the ſtudy of Chriſtian Prudence, and the evidencing thereof, as uſeful to direct Men how to walk in ſuch difficult Caſes, as have been ſpoken of before, eſpecially when they have to do with incenſed Rulers, who abuſe their power by exalting Vile Men, and bearing down the better ſort; and to direct them how to keep a ſtraight Courſe, that they may neither give juſt occaſion of Diſpleaſure to thoſe in Authority, nor miſcarry toward them when they are unjuſtly incenſed.</p>
                  <p>And for this End, He <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhews what a Loſs and Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Men have, who are not <hi>Sharp-ſighted</hi> in ſuch difficult Caſes, it will coſt them great pains to come to any clearneſs what to do; and this he ſets out in terms borrowed from one working with a blunt <hi>Iron,</hi> it will coſt him much force and pains to effectuat any thing by it: So if a Man, in ſuch dark Caſes, find his Wit very <hi>blunt,</hi> and that he hath formerly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to uſe all lawful Means for ſharpening of it, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Underſtanding, that he might know his Duty; then muſt he exerce more <hi>Strength,</hi> and be at the more pains, which may be both taken as his diſadvantage, and an intimation of his Correction for his former Lazineſs, that he muſt now muſter up the more Forces (for the Word <hi>Strength</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Army</hi>) before he can get any thing done to purpoſe: And it alſo imports his Duty upon ſuppoſition of his preſent Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of former Negligence, it is his beſt now to be at the more pains.</p>

                  <p>Hence Learn 1. When Mens Caſes are moſt difficult, and they have moſt to do with their Wit, they will readily find it moſt dull and blunt, as the Fruit of their former Lazineſs, and want of pains in ſharpening of it, their not fore-caſting of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties (for ſo being ſurpriſed with them, their Fear darkens their Reaſon) and the Lord's with-drawing Light for a time, to drive them to His Word and Spirit for Counſel: For in ſuch a Caſe doth this Similitude ſuppoſe Men to be in reference to the difficult Caſe formerly mentioned, <hi>If the Iron be blunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When Men find their Wit dull and blunt in taking up their Duty, or their Courage abated to venture upon it thorow Difficulties, they ought to labour to ſharpen the one, and raiſe up the other by ſerious meditation upon the Word for Light, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.24. imploring the help of the Spirit, <hi>who leads in all truth, Pſ.</hi> 143.10. and by the uſe of every other Mean, which the Lord uſes to Bleſs to His People, for increaſe of their Light and ſtrength in Straits, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4. For while he ſaith, <hi>If the Iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge,</hi> he doth not approve of neglecting to whet it, but rather minds of the Duty which ſhould be gone about in caſe of former Negligence, <hi>Then muſt he put to more ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When Lazineſs or Negligence in the uſe of Means, doth accompany Dulneſs and Darkneſs of Mind, and want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, it puts Men to much pains and toil before they can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuat any thing; yea and more than might formerly have ſharpened and fitted them for their Duty, and made the ſame eaſie to them: For this may be looked upon as a great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they ſhall have, who are both Lazy and Dull, <hi>If the Iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more force.</hi>
                  </p>

ſmall, ſo as after many Eſſays, we come litle nearer our point; yet the ſenſe and diſcerning hereof ought to be ſo far from making us ſit up, and quite our hopes of any ſucceſs, that it ſhould make us double our diligence in the uſe of all lawful Means, eſpecially in imploying the Lord for pardon of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Negligence, and for his teaching now in a new Strait: For this <hi>putting to of more ſtrength,</hi> may be looked upon as a Mans beſt in the Caſe ſuppoſed, <hi>If the Iron be blunt, and he do not whet</hi> (or have not whetted) <hi>the edge, then muſt he put to more strength.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5, It is not our carnal Reaſon, nor the counſel of the wiſeſt of worldly Men, that will be a good Guide to us in dark times, and difficult Caſes, eſpecially when we may be in hazard of Suffering.

                  <p>THe Preacher doth farther prove the neceſſity of heavenly Wiſdom, by ſhewing the hazard of the want of it, and the farther advantage of having it in ſuch difficult Caſes as have been formerly mentioned, when Men have to do with offended Rulers, and becauſe Mens Raſhneſs and Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion often manifeſted by their reproachful Speeches againſt theſe in Authority, occaſion much trouble to them, and that juſtly: Therefore he teaches here, that heavenly Wiſdom is to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in bridling and reſtraining the Tongue from raſh and malicious Diſcourſes, and imploying the ſame in edifying and ſavoury Speeches.</p>
                  <p>And for this end he doth <hi>Firſt</hi> by a Similitude point out the evil and hazard of ſlanderous and detracting Speeches, <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Serpent will bit without Inchantment;</hi> It is known that Similitudes taken from Serpents, Scorpions and Aſps, are frequently made uſe of in Scripture, to ſet out that Wickedneſs and Venome which is vented by the Tongue, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. As for the <hi>Inchanting</hi> of Serpents here ſpoken of, it can make nothing for defence of the uſe of Magick, or ſuch divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Arts, ſeing Similitudes may be drawn from the worſt things to illuſtrat the beſt, as Chriſt's ſecond Coming, is compared to the coming of a Theef in the Night: Beſide the Word tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>Inchantment</hi> ſignifies nothing but a <hi>low way of ſpeaking,</hi> or muttering, which poſſibly hath been in uſe in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time to divert or deter Serpents from offending or ſtinging, or to take them that they might be ſlain. And the Scripture uſes this ſame Word for any effectual way of dealing with Men by words, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:51442:266"/>
Eloquence, or moving Arguments. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.3. And ſo by <hi>Inchantment</hi> (to apply the Similitude) is meant nothing but the exerciſe of that heavenly Wiſdom, which teaches Men to ſpeak mild and pacifying Words, eſpecially to provoked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and without this a <hi>Babler</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) or as the Word is in the Original, one that is <hi>Lord of the Tongue,</hi> who ſpeaks as freely, whatever his ambitious Spirit incenſed with Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment ſuggeſts, as if he were to make account to none, <hi>He is no better</hi> than the Serpent that bites, and ſo readily procures his own Ruine (as the Serpent doth) from thoſe whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes by his bitter Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> He ſhews the Advantage of that heavenly Wiſdom, which is that it teaches the Man indued with it, to make uſe of ſuch Words as may miniſter Grace to others, and conciliat the Grace or Favour even of offended Rulers, and ſo <hi>his Words are gracious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He inlarges the woful Effects of the inconſiderat and raſh Carriage of Men void of this Wiſdom, eſpecially in their Diſcourſes, while he ſaith, <hi>The lips of a Fool will ſwallow up himſelf.</hi> The <hi>Lips</hi> being one of the Inſtruments of Speech, are put for the Speech it ſelf, by a Figure ordinary in Scripture, theſe <hi>ſwallow</hi> up a Man, when he by his raſh Words inſnares himſelf, and ſo proves his own Deſtroyer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> He deſcribes the progreſs of ſlanderous and envious Speeches, the riſe or principle of them, is <hi>Levity</hi> or Inconſtancy, as the Word <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> ſignifies, but they go on to worſe, till the Man at laſt ſhew himſelf acted with Fury (as the other word <hi>miſchievous Madneſs</hi> ſignifies) whereby he is put upon mad Courſes againſt them whom he envies, and ſuch as prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. It is not more natural to a Serpent to ſting or bite, when no means are uſed to prevent or reſtrain it, than it is to a Man void of the Wiſdom of God, to vent his Malice upon any diſcontentment, by bitter and reproachful Speeches
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:51442:267"/>
againſt others, eſpecially thoſe in Authority, of whom the Diſcourſe all along doth mainly run: Therefore doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God here and elſewhere make uſe of this and the like Similitudes, to ſet out the Poiſon which a malicious Heart caſts out by the Tongue, <hi>Surely the Serpent will bite without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and a Babler is no better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Opprobrious and Invective Speeches are extremely bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and do exceedingly wound the Spirits of them againſt whom they are vented, they are in a manner deadly, and hardly can the Wound given to ones Reputation by them, be healed again, as is imported alſo in this Similitude, which ſets forth the Evil of this Sin, it is like <hi>the byting of a Serpent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inchantment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heavenly Wiſdom teaches Chriſtians a holy Art of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting their own Tongues, making them to ſpeak ſuch ſoft Language as may pacifie the Paſſions of others, and not wound or ſting them: For he ſuppoſes that heavenly Wiſdom will teach Men this Art, that their Tongues ſhall not be like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents biting others, while, as a Commendation of that Wiſdom, he ſaith, <hi>Surely the Serpent will bite without Inchantment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The reaſon of Mens raſh and inconſiderat Speeches, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as tend to the diſgrace of thoſe in lawful Authority, is that they look upon their Tongues as their own, and upon themſelves as abſolute Lords and Maſters of their Diſcourſes: For the Word here tranſlated a <hi>Babler,</hi> is in the Original, he that is Lord or <hi>Master of the Tongue,</hi> to wit, in his own conceit.</p>

in this Book the name of the <hi>Fool,</hi> by giving ſome Reſemblances between him and a natural <hi>Fool.</hi> And <hi>First</hi> he deſcribes him from the multitude of his <hi>Words, he is full</hi> of them, Or (as the original bears) he <hi>multiplies</hi> or <hi>magnifies</hi> his words, importing his Boaſting, eſpecially of future Events; as appears by the following words, wherein the Preacher makes anſwer to ſome of his words, he boaſts of what he will do afterward without dependance upon God, and to this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>a Man cannot tell what ſhall be:</hi> It being only proper to God to foretell fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 44.7.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He deſcribes ſuch a Man from the fruitfulneſs of his indeavours, he is like a blind Fool that is out of the way to a City, and wearies himſelf to find it, though that be one of the eaſieſt things, that even Children may know, ſo the Man who is void of true and ſaving Wiſdom, ſpends himſelf in fruitleſs indeavours, and cannot ſo much as manage aright the moſt common of his Affairs</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Unleſs a Mans Wit be ſanctified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about the ſtudy of Reconciliation with God thorow Chriſt, and the way of Glorifying him by Living in his fear and obedience, though he were eſteemed an Oracle for Worldly Wit among men, he is a very Fool to himſelf, and in Gods eſteem the beſt of his Wiſdom is Fooliſhneſs: therefore doth the Spirit of God here by <hi>Solomon,</hi> as frequently elſewhere in Scripture, deſcribe the unregenerat Man by the carriage and practice of a meer Fool, and the deſcription agrees even to ſuch as <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel, A Fool alſo is full of words, a Man cannot tell what ſhall be.</hi>

                  <p>For clearing of this, we may conſider <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he ſpeaks to the <hi>Land,</hi> intending the Inhabitants thereof, as is frequent in Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.29. the more to move the People who have bad Magiſtrates to reſent their own ſad Caſe, and to ſearch out, and mourn for the procuring Cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to incite them who have good Magiſtrates over them, to be thankful to God for ſo great a Bleſſing.</p>

to wit, the Wickedneſs or Goodneſs of thoſe in power, may have influence upon the Well or Wo of the people, in reference to their ſpiritual and eternal Condition, they being drawn to many Sins and Temptations by the one, and encouraged much in Wel-doing by the other.</p>

And <hi>First</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> or ſupreme Ruler, whoſe Land is miſerable, he deſcribes him from this, that he is a <hi>Child,</hi> which is not to be underſtood of his Years or Age: For the Scripture is clear, that people have been happy under a young King, even a Child being vertuouſly inclined, and well governed by wiſe Over-ſeers, as is clear in <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 24.2.17. and others: And therefore it is to be underſtood of his Childiſh Diſpoſition, Wiſdom, Sobriety, and other Vertues, qualifying Men for Government, being wanting in him; in which ſenſe <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> though one and fourty Years old when he began to Reign, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.21. is yet ſpoken of as a Child. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.17. Next for inferiour Magiſtrates or Princes, they are deſcribed from their Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Intemperance, they <hi>eat in the morning;</hi> whereby is meant that they are Men addicted to their Luſts, their own Intereſts and Pleaſures (whereof one is put for all others) the ſatisfaction whereof they preferr to the welfare of the people, and are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, therewith even at theſe ſeaſons which ſhould be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the weighty Duties of their place, For in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys their Judicatories ſat in the morning, <hi>Jer,</hi> 21.12. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> He deſcribes the Rulers whoſe Land is Happy.

truly Noble Qualifications of Wiſdom, Piety, and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned, fitting him for Government; when theſe are in a man in an eminent meaſure, he is then <hi>the Son of Nobles,</hi> that is, truly and eminently Noble: For the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by ſuch Expreſſions as this, hold forth the ſuperlative degree, <hi>a Son of Belial,</hi> is a man extremely wicked, ſo <hi>the Son of Nobles</hi> is one of a truly Noble Spirit, eminently qualified for Government. And next for the inferiour Magiſtrates, they are deſcribed from their Sobriety, and right uſing of the Creatures, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of all the Priviledges accompanying their Place and Dignity, they uſe them all to ſtrengthen them for their Duty, and not for the ſatisfaction of their Luſts.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. It becomes the Miniſters of Chriſt clearly to repreſent to people their miſery, even in reference to their outward condition, and the cauſes thereof, though in ſo doing they be neceſſitat to diſcover the wickedneſs of their Rulers, both ſupreme and inferiour, which ought to be no offence to them, while they find Miniſters preſſing alſo upon people all Duties they owe to Rulers, as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath done before, that people may be ſtirred up to mourn for their ſins, which have procured the ſetting up of ſuch: And it is alſo their Duty to deſcribe the Happineſs of people, as to their outward condition, who have good Magiſtrates, that they may be thankful to God for ſo great a mercy: And this they ought to do with ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and reſentment of the one caſe, and with rejoicing and praiſe for the other: For ſo doth the Preacher here. <hi>Wo to thee, O Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed are thou, O Land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Magiſtrates and Rulers that are vitious and inſufficient for Government, are great Plagues to the Land over which they are ſet, and bring much Wo upon the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, partly by their bad Example encouraging others to ſin. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 12.8. and partly by their tolerating and eſtabliſhing of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by a Law. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. And ſo drawing down Judgements upon their Subjects, and that not only in their

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. As it is too frequently found that when the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat is unfit for, or defective in the Diſcharge of the duties belonging to his place, the Inferiour Magiſtrats are no better, but rather worſe, he being careful to get ſuch only as will ſerve him in his ſinful humour, preferred to places of power under him; and they again being apt to abuſe his ſimplicity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, by making his power and means ſubſervient to to their Carnal Ends: So when the Inferiour Magiſtrats are ſuch it doth much augment the Woe and Miſery of the people who might be relieved by their prudence and fidelity ſupplying the defects of the Supream: For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly joined, and this laſt as a ſpecial Addition to their Miſery whoſe caſe it is, <hi>Wo to thee O Land when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the Morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Magiſtrates give up themſelves to the ſatisfaction of their ſenſual Luſts, eſpecially their intemperancy, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then wholly indiſpoſed for managing of the weighty affairs of their place, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. and cannot but prove a great plague to their Inferiours: For this is a deſcription of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:51442:271"/>
thoſe who prove a <hi>Woe</hi> to the Land, they are <hi>Princes that eat in the Morning.</hi>

Though Nobility of Blood be an advantage to Supream Magiſtrats, ſuch being ordinarly better Trained up for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than others, and ſo leſs apt to be raviſhed or puft up with the Honours, to which they are born, or the Applauſe of the People, with which from their Birth they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed; And leſs obnoxious to the contempt of many, than thoſe who riſe upon a ſudden, or from a mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſuch Dignity (who notwithſtanding being called of God and his people will be ſufficiently fitted for their place, as <hi>David</hi> was) yet the Nobility mainly requiſit in Magiſtrats is, that of their Diſpoſition and carriage conſiſting in the eminency of their inward qualifications, ſuch as the knowledge and fear of the Lord, which makes them truely excellent ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a Bleſſing which hath many Bleſſings in the boſome of it, to have ſuch a Supream Magiſtrat, as hath been deſcribed in the former Doctrine: Then iniquity will be ſuppreſſed, and Piety and Equity advanced <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. and when it is ſo, God will rain Bleſſings upon the people, for the word is here in the plural number: There are <hi>Bleſſednſſes</hi> to the Land, <hi>whoſe King is the Son of Nobles.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Cauſe is, The <hi>ſlothfulneſs</hi> of the Rulers, and this he ſets out by a proverbial ſpeech, which may be applyed to many things; but it ſeems moſt conſonant to the whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Chapter, to apply it to the Caſe of a Common-wealth, tending to ruine thorow the lazineſs of their Rulers: <hi>By much ſlothfulneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the building decayeth,</hi> the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being taken from a ſlothful Maſter of a Family: The words are in the Original, <hi>by the ſlothfulneſs of them both,</hi> or by <hi>double</hi> ſlothfulneſs, which may import it to be exceeding great, according to our Tranſlation, or by the ſlothfulneſs of both the hands, which may be the Supreme and Inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, who ſhould be like two hands, jointly concurring to uphold the Common-wealth. And <hi>thorow Idleneſs,</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) the falling down or remiſſneſs of the hands, <hi>the Houſe droppeth thorow,</hi> and ſo the Timber rots, and the whole Houſe is ruined, where the Breaches are not repaired: So doth it fare with a Kingdom or Common-wealth (which is often in Scripture compared to a Houſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.6. and 5.7.) where the Rulers, who ſhould be Repairers of the Breaches, and Builders up of the Ruines thereof, neglect their Duty, and indulge their own Eaſe, nothing but Decay and Ruine can be expected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Next</hi> Cauſe is Luxury, if the Maſter of a Houſe when he ſhould be repairing the Ruines of it, be Feaſting and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merry, and ſpending what he hath within it, when it is comming down, the Caſe is very ſad: So when Magiſtrates mind mainly their own ſatisfaction and pleaſure, and do not ſoberly and ſeaſonably, as thoſe whom he commended before, eat for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſs, ruine cannot but come upon the Common-wealth; and the effect of their Luxury he inſinuates to be the poverty of the Countrey or people under them, while he ſaith, <hi>Money anſwers all,</hi> theſe Rulers muſt
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:51442:272"/>
have Money to uphold all theſe Feaſts, and provide that Wine which makes them merry, and that muſt be ſucked from the poor people to anſwer their Luſts; and ſo the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is exhauſted, and the people impoveriſhed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Land that hath ſuch Rulers muſt be very miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. A Common-wealth is fitly reſembled to a Houſe; wherein there ſhould be Order and Subordination among the Heads or Governours and Members thereof, as there is in a Houſe, a Houſe being held up and furniſhed is commodious for Habitation, a ſhelter from Storm and Tempeſt, and ſo will a well governed Common-wealth be. And as a Houſe by the leaſt decay, if not timouſly repaired, will ſoon be Ruined, ſo it is with a Common-wealth. And Finally, as a Houſe decaying and letting Rain <hi>drop thorow,</hi> makes the Life of the Inhabitant very uncomfortable; ſo is it in a Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Common-wealth. Therefore is it that the Spirit of God directs <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſet forth the Caſe of a Common-wealth, under the ſimilitude of a <hi>Houſe, By much ſlothfulneſs the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding decayeth, and</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the Subjects of a Kingdom or Common-wealth, have often a hand in procuring the Ruine thereof, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5. yet the Lord doth charge the ſame upon the Rulers. And though they be not Oppreſſours or Tyrants, yet if they be Men given to their eaſe, or of ſmall activity for the good of the Common-wealth, they may be charged with the Ruine thereof: For the Context ſhews that this <hi>ſlothfulneſs</hi> is mainly to be underſtood in reference to the Rulers: <hi>By much ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Building decayeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Decay or Ruine of a Common-wealth or Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be reſented by all the Inhabitants, as the miſery of every one of them, though poſſibly for the preſent ſeveral of their private Intereſts may remain entire, while Ruine is coming upon the Publick, becauſe miſery will at laſt reach them, and the publick Good ſhould be dearer to them than
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:51442:273"/>
their own particular. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> brings this as a proof of Wo to a Land, and ſo to all the Inhabitants thereof, that the <hi>Houſe,</hi> which is the Common-wealth, is <hi>decaying</hi> and <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth thorow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where Slothfulneſs and Idleneſs prevail, there <hi>Luxury</hi> and exceſs in the uſe of worldly Injoyments prevail alſo: For upon neglect of lawful diligence, the Fleſh waxes wanton, and muſt be pampered. Therefore this is ſet down as the ſecond Cauſe of the Ruine, following upon the ſlothfulneſs of Rulers, which is the firſt Cauſe, their <hi>Luxury</hi> and Exceſs, <hi>A Feast is made for laughter, and Wine to make merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though Slothfulneſs and Idleneſs bring miſery upon the Sluggard by degrees, as a Ruinous Houſe takes in Rain by Drop and Drop at firſt; yet being continued in, they will at laſt, by their effects proclaim his miſery to On-lookers: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Preacher ſet forth the Fruit of Slothfulneſs, by the decay and dropping thorow of a Houſe, which, if not repaired, will make the Ruine of it viſible to all that paſs by, and force the lazy Inhabitant either to periſh in its Ruine, or ſeek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Habitation. <hi>By much ſlothfulneſs the Building decayeth, and by the idleneſs of the hands the Houſe droppeth thorow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As the Luxury and Exceſs of Rulers, is a Cauſe and ſign of Ruine in part begun, and more haſtening upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under their Charge; ſo ſuch men having once given up themſelves to their Luſts, they will follow them even amidſt the Evidences of God's Diſpleaſure againſt them: For this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude taken from the lazy Inhabitant, who while his Houſe is decaying and dropping in upon him, is Feaſting and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merry with his Companions, thinking thereby to divert the ſad Thoughts of his ruinous Houſe, which he will not get long done, repreſents the Temper and Carriage of wicked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who while the Common-wealth is decaying, the people growing poor, and publick Treaſures exhauſting, are Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, making merry, and ſpending all upon their Luſts; in
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:51442:273"/>
which caſe it is here ſaid, <hi>A Feaſt is made for laughter, and Wine maketh merry, but Money anſwers all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. God taketh notice both of the ſeaſons of Mens Eating and Drinking, eſpecially in Feaſting, and of the Ends which they propoſe to themſelves in ſo doing, whether they intend only their own ſenſual ſatisfaction and carnal mirth, or the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Bodies for doing the Lord ſervice. For the Spirit of God, by <hi>Solomon,</hi> having ſhewn to the commendation of good Magiſtrats, that they <hi>Eat in ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſs,</hi> here takes notice of wicked Rulers Feaſting when Ruine is coming upon the Common-wealth, and of the Ends they propoſe to themſelves, their own carnal mirth and pleaſure, <hi>A Feaſt is made</hi> (to wit, by ſuch Men) <hi>for laughter, and Wine makes merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. When Magiſtrates are negligent of their Duty, and yet luxurious and ſenſual, the people under their Charge cannot but be impoveriſhed, they muſt have Money, for which the Poor muſt ſweat in digging the Earth, trafficking by Sea or Land, and the like: For the peoples poverty is here inſinuat, as the effect of the Rulers ſlothfulneſs and prodigality, They <hi>Feaſt and make merry,</hi> but <hi>Money anſwereth,</hi> or procureth, <hi>all theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Though Money of it ſelf be the moſt uſeleſs thing in the World, for ſuſtentation of humane Life; yet Providence hath made it ſo uſeful, that ordinarly it anſwers him that hath it with all things neceſſary for him, and makes them <hi>Obedient</hi> (as the Word <hi>Anſwereth</hi> ſignifies) to him. Therefore they that have much of it, had need to look how, they anſwer the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Duty from them. <hi>For Money anſwereth all things.</hi>

The <hi>1.</hi> Taken from the bounty of God in furnishing the Creatures for Mans uſe, inſtancing in the Clouds expending their Treaſures upon the Earth to make it fruitful and ſerviceable to man, <hi>ver. 3.</hi> The <hi>2.</hi> Is taken from the benefit that redounds thereby to the perſon giving whatever the object be, and as from the obedience he owes to his Maker; So alſo from the Eternal Eſtate of our Souls, which shall be according as they are found at death held forth by the ſimilitud of a felled tree, which whatſoever way it falls, yet as it is profitable to the owner, and is paſſively obedient to him, to be employed at his pleaſure: ſo where it falls, there it lyes and it to be found. <hi>ver. 3.</hi> He obviats theſe Objections which ordinarly men plead for denying or delaying theſe Works of Charity, ariſing from ſuch emergents in their Condition, as may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion want and miſery to themſelves before they die <hi>1,</hi> By shewing the folly of looking upon future events (as Huſband men by too much fearing the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Wind and Rain, forbear ſowing and reaping) ſo as to diſcourage from

Or by <hi>Waters</hi> underſtand the <hi>Poor,</hi> becauſe what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them ſeems to be loſt, as if it were caſt into the Sea; and we are to look upon them as Waters that paſs away, and never return to give us Thanks for our Charity, it is all one as to the purpoſe in hand: For it is clear that Charity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence to the <hi>Poor</hi> is the Duty here preſt, and the ſupply to be given them is called <hi>Bread,</hi> becauſe in Scripture all that is neceſſary for humane Life, is ordinarly comprehended under that name. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11. And becauſe <hi>Bread</hi> is moſt neceſſary for the Poor, and moſt common among all to be diſtribute, and this Bread muſt be properly their own who give it.</p>

                  <p>Hence Learn 1. Though our Charity or Liberality to the Poor, cannot merit any thing from the Lord, ſeing we can only give what He hath firſt freely given to us, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. yet the ſame is a ſtep of the way to Felicity, wherein the Lord will have His People to walk: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who would uſe the outward Bleſſings of this Life, ſo as his true Happineſs may be promoved thereby, muſt not only have a Heart to uſe them liberally and cheerfully, ſo far as may
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:51442:277"/>
conſiſt with Sobriety and Holineſs, for his incouragement in his Maſters ſervice but he muſt alſo have a Heart to give out a part thereof to others in neceſſity: For <hi>Solomon</hi> having frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt the former in order to Mans Happineſs, he comes here to preſs the latter in order to the ſame end, as is clear, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this to his general Scope, which is to direct miſerable Man in the right way to his true Felicity, <hi>Cast thy Bread upon the Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the Lords People have the only true Riches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Knowledge, Wiſdom, and the like; yet the Lord ſees it fit that many of them be very poor as to the World, and deſtitute of outward Injoyments, not having ſo much of their own often times as Bread to eat, or Raiment to put on, that He may try others Charity and reſpect to His Commands, the faith and patience of his own, and may evidence that theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things are not his beſt Gifts: For it is ſuppoſed in this Exhortation, that there will be many very poor among His deareſt people, whoſe ſupply He mainly calls for here, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes largely to Reward, while he ſaith, <hi>Cast thy Bread upon the Waters, and give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4.

The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſeems clearly to be taken from the Lords bounty and liberality in making his Creatures ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and comfortable to Man, whereof he giveth one inſtance for many, <hi>if the Clouds be full of Rain they empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Earth,</hi> that is, the Clouds keep not the Rain to themſelves, but pour out the ſame freely and plentifully upon the Earth, that it may yeild Bread to Man, whereby the Lord proves his Liberality towards him: And therefore he ſhould willingly give of his Bread to the Hungry: And this appears to be the meaning, by other places of Scripture where Charity is ſet forth by the ſame ſimilitude, as in that of Chriſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon Men bounty to others, <hi>he makes the rain to fall upon the juſt and unjuſt</hi> Mat. 5.45 And that of <hi>Solomon, He that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> Prov. 11.25.</p>
                  <p>The next Argument held out under the ſimilitude of <hi>a Tree ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where it falls,</hi> is more dark, becauſe it is variouſly applied to the purpoſe by Interpreters: And yet all that variety ſerveth to preſs the ſame duty of Charity. As 1. It makes for the ſcope if we take it thus, as the Tree, what way ſoever it falls, lyeth to be uſeful for the owner, ſo ſhall it be in the matter of Charity, where the intention is honeſt, and due Caution ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the giving of it, whatever the perſons be, whether good or bad upon whom it is beſtowed, it ſhall redound to the benefit of the giver. Or 2. Thus, As a Tree is ſerviceable to Man, and lyeth under a kind of paſſive obedience to him, to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſes, ſo ſhould Man be moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to act in obedience to his Maker, and let out a part of what he freely receives from him, for the good of others in obedience to his command. Or 3. If we apply it thus, as a Tree what way ſo ever it fall, there it lyes, and ſo it is to be found, even ſo is it with Man as to his Soul. he ſhall be for ever in that Eſtate wherein he falls at Death, and therefore he ſhould in his life be doing good, that Death may find him at his duty.</p>

                     <pb n="509" facs="tcp:51442:279"/>Hence Learn. 1. The Lords liberality to man manifeſted in the ordinary courſe of his providence, making the Clouds to pour down Rain in abundance to make the Earth fruitful, and the fruits thereof to wait upon him to be diſpoſed at his pleaſure, ſhould move him to Liberality toward others who are in neceſſity, elſe he may expect that theſe Creatures which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes ſhall witneſs one day againſt him in his Conſcience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.3. And therefore from the Creatures, whether theſe that are above his head ſerving him, or theſe that ly at his feet ready to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his ſervice, he ſhould learn his duty to his Maker, for ſo doth the Wiſe Man reaſon to preſs this duty of Charity, <hi>If the Clouds be full of Rain they empty themſelves upon the Earth, and if the Tree fall toward the South or toward the North, in the place where it falleth, there it ſhall be.</hi>

When a Man finds any of the Creatures in a paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, ready to be imployed by him for his uſe, and as it were offering their Service to him as a fallen Tree doth, that ſhould make him active in his duty to his Maker, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing the Creatures do not fly from him, who is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a fugitive from God, nor fight againſt him who is a Rebel to his Maker, he ſhould move the more cheerfully in his obedience; For ſo much may be drawn from the ſimilitude of a Tree lying for Mans uſe where it falls, here made uſe of as an Argument to Charity, <hi>whether the Tree fall toward the South, or toward the North, in the place where the Tree falls there it ſhall be.</hi>

Yet where the intention of the Giver, is Honeſt, and endeavours to diſcern what manner of perſons they are to whom he gives, though he may be miſtaken, and let his Charity fall upon the worſt, his reward ſhall be no leſs than if it fell upon the better ſort; for thus alſo may this ſimilitude be turned into an Argument for Charity, as holding forth the certainty of the reward thereof, whether the Objects of it be good or

<pb n="511" facs="tcp:51442:280"/>
doth forbear Sowing or Reaping, will never (it is propbable) either Sow or Reap: The Application of which ſimilitude is not expreſt, but may be eaſily gathered from the Scope, thus, Even ſo he who looks to all future contingencies which may diſcourage, or hinder him in his duty, will readily never ſet about it; And particularly he that neglects Charity to others, when God calls him to it, becauſe of every Suggeſtion that his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may ſoon be exhauſted, will never caſt his Bread upon the Waters; and ſo never reap the reward promiſed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of that duty.</p>
                  <p>Next, He ſhewes the Weakneſs of that ſort of Reaſoning to deter Men from their Duty, and proves they ſhould not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect it, though the appearance of ſucceſs be never to ſmall, by an Argument taken from the unſearchable depth of Gods Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom manifeſted in his ordinary operations, and that Men may be convinced of their Ignorance, and ſo not deſpair of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what God hath promiſed, though they ſee no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof, he inſtances two things very near to every Man, and yet clearly underſtood by none. The firſt inſtance is, that Men <hi>know not the way of the Spirit,</hi> that is, they are ignorant how their own Souls are formed and united to their Bodies, how they exiſt and act while they are in the Body: and when they are ſeparat from it: The other is, that <hi>none knows how the Bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child,</hi> that is, none doth clearly underſtand that wonderful Work, the forming of his own Body in the Womb, and from mens Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe things, he doth infer that they cannot diſtinctly conceive the way of Gods working for performing his promiſes to them that venture upon commanded duties, when there is no probability of reward for ſo doing: And to help them the more confidenty to expect the promiſed reward of duty though there be no appearance of it, be repreſents the Lord under the notion of Creator, who gives a Beeing to, Things that are not; And therefore Men may cheerfully follow their
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:51442:281"/>
Duty to him, and particularly give of their ſubſtance for relief of his poor People, though they ſee no probability of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. A faithful Miniſter muſt not only preſs Duty, and enforce the ſame by Reaſons, but alſo he muſt carefully forſee what Reaſons people may pretend to hinder them from Duty, or diſcourage them in it, and demonſtrat the Levity and Weakneſs of every thing that may have weight with them, to make them delay their Duty, or neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity thereof: For ſo doth this heavenly Preacher here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath by ſeveral Reaſons preſt the Duty of Charity, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Hinderances thereof, and confutes theſe Objections which Men ordinarly make againſt it, whereupon they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or delay it, while he ſaith, <hi>He that obſerveth the Wind ſhall not ſow, and he that regardeth the Clouds ſhall not reap,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. We have ſo much natural averſion to our Duty, and ſo much unbelief of the promiſed Reward, that we are ready to make every appearance of a Difficulty, a ſufficient ground to quite our Duty: For though the Weather will often be lowring,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:51442:281"/>
and the Air tempeſtuous, when a little after, the Seaſon will be favourable enough; yet it is ſuppoſed that Men are very apt by ſuch ſmall appearances of Difficulty, to be hindered from their Duty, while the wiſe Man thus confutes them, even by relating their Objections under this Similitude, <hi>He that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Wind ſhall not ſow, and he that regards the Clouds ſhall not reap.</hi>
                  </p>

If Men would reaſon in Matters relating to their Duty to God, and their eternal Welfare, as they ordinarly do in the matters of this Life, they would not be ſo often hindred from their Duty, or diſcouraged in it, but that reaſoning which hath no weight with them in things of an earthly and ſmall Concernment, the ſame ſeems moſt ſtrong in reference to the greateſt matters of their Soul, and another Life: For here it is ſuppoſed, that Men do not ordinarly reaſon from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Rain or Wind, that they ſhould neglect to Sow or Reap, and ſo of other things, elſe they would ſeldom or never do what they are ſeldom or never found to neglect in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſeaſon thereof; and yet that they do too frequently from any appearance of hard Events reaſon, that they muſt neglect neceſſary Duties, particularly that of Charity here preſt, <hi>He

There is ſo much Wiſdom manifeſted in all the Works of God, and we are ſo blind, and ſpend ſo much of the little Wit we have upon other things, that there is not any of theſe works, that can be fully comprehended by us: this is clearly ſuppoſed in the other Branch of <hi>Solomons</hi> Confutation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay or neglect of Duty, upon appearance of bad ſucceſs, <hi>as thou knowest not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo thou knoweſt not the work of God who mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all.</hi>

For here the incomprehenſible Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, manifeſted in forming of the Spirits and Bodies of Men, is brought as a motive to the Duty of Charity; and to make Men charitable (ſo to ſpeak) of God, that He can eaſily prevent their Fears of Loſs and Want, make up their Loſſes, and make good His own Promiſes, <hi>As thou knoweſt not

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:51442:283"/>
meaning is, that we are uncertain whether that Comfort and Satisfaction we aim at, ſhall be found in this, or in the other particular Performance, or in both of them, or in none of them, but in ſome other than that wherein we mainly expect it, or if it be applied to the Duty of Charity, the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in reference to the right improvement or uſe making of our Charity, by the party to whom it is given, and to the Lords teſtifying of his Acceptance of this, or the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act of Charity.</p>
                  <p>And if it be enquired, What ſtrength hath the Argument drawn from our Ignorance or Uncertainty of theſe, to enforce the Duty of Charity? It may be anſwered, 1. That the words ſuppoſe an uncertainty only of Succeſs as to every act of Duty, but do ſuppoſe a certainty of Succeſs in ſome: For he ſaith not thou knoweſt not whether <hi>any thing</hi> thou doeſt ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, but thou knoweſt not <hi>whether</hi> ſhall proſper, <hi>this or that.</hi> And 2 It is an Argument in ſo far as our being uncertain but that there may be ſucceſs of every act of Duty, is ground and reaſon of going about Duty at all occaſions, ſeing Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the general, and the future Reward is made ſure to us.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. A Chriſtians following of commanded Duties, is fitly compared to the ſowing of Seed, it being a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exerciſe in the mean time, and ſeeming rather a Loſing than a Gaining, there being no preſent appearance of Fruit, and it will at laſt, where it is ſincerely gone about, bring a rich Increaſe: For under this Metaphor, is Duty here, and elſewhere in Scripture preſt, <hi>In the Morning ſow thy Seed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every commanded Duty is ſo contrary to our unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part, and we are ſo prone to think much of the leaſt thing we do, that we are very ready to ſit up, and give over our Duty, after we have begun fair, and made ſome good progreſs therein, unleſs by the word enlivened by the Spirit of him that ſpoke it, we be frequently quickened and excited to our

Duty, for to work ſome ſenſe of our pronneſs to ſit up, and to incite us to perſeverance and frequency in Duty, eſpecially ſuch as take any thing of our worldly ſubſtance from us, is this Exhortation given, <hi>In the Morning ſow thy Seed, and in the Evening with-hold not thy hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our Obligations to God are ſo many, and the ſtrength allowed us ſo ſutable to what may be accepted, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed ſo glorious, that we ſhould never think we have done enough in any Duty, but even to the Evening of every day, and to the very Evening of our Life, we ſhould ſtill be ready to do ſome farther ſervice to God, <hi>In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſow thy Seed, and in the Evening with-hold not thy hand.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Our uncertainty of the deſired ſucceſs of every particular Duty, ſhould be ſo far from making us neglect the diſcharge thereof, that on the contrary, the ſame ſhould make us more aſſiduous and frequent therein, ſince we are ſure of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and a Reward at laſt of all our Pains in his Service, if the Merchant whoſe hopes have the inſtability of Fortune to ſtruggle with, doth adventure ſome part of his Stock in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Veſſels, and the Husband-man, who is not certain that

every grain he ſows will grow up, yet both hold on in their duty in hope of ſucceſs; How much more ſhould Chriſtians, who have better grounds of certainty that their Labour ſhall not be in vain, be aſſiduous and conſtant in their duty, how doubtful ſoever they be of the temporal ſucceſs of this, or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duty: For this he makes a motive to provoke thoſe who have the promiſe of ſucceſs at laſt, to conſtancy and frequency in duty, <hi>thou knowest not whether ſhall proſper, this or that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they both ſhall be alike good.</hi>

                  <p>IN this ſecond part of the Chapter which is the beginning of the laſt part of this Book, the Preacher applies his whole Doctrine, and preſſeth the principal uſe thereof, which is that men ſhould make ſerious and timous preparation for Death, Judgement and Eternity: And for this end becauſe that which mainly diverts Men from this ſtudy is the apprehenſion they have of much pleaſure in things Earthly: Therefore he doth <hi>First,</hi> By way of conceſſion yeild to Men, that there is ſome ſweetneſs and pleaſure in the injoyment of Creature-comforts: For, by the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>pleaſantneſs for beholding the Sun,</hi> are meant, all the Comforts of this preſent Life, which make it Sweet and Pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Next, Upon ſuppoſition that Men have never ſo long a Life, and the ſame never ſo much ſweetned by the injoyment of Creature-comforts, he preſſeth upon them, that they ſhould remember Death, as certainly abiding them, and conſequently prepare for it: For by <hi>the days of darkneſs which are many,</hi> is chiefly meant the ſtate of Death, ſo called, becauſe under it Men are deprived of thoſe Earthly Comforts, which are ſet
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:51442:285"/>
orth by the pleaſantneſs of the Light, and ſweetneſs of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun: And by the ſame alſo may be underſtood, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the Wickeds Torment, becauſe that is moſt fitly ſignified by the <hi>many days of Darkneſs,</hi> and the conſideration thereof is moſt powerful to ſtir up Men to prepare for Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> He paſſeth ſentence upon thoſe Earthly Comforts, which ſo take up the Hearts of Men, that thoughts of Death are baniſhed, while he ſaith, <hi>all that cometh is Vanity,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is, that all Creature-comforts without the ſpiritual and ſanctified uſe of them, whereby Men are led to Comforts of a higher nature, are empty of any true ſatisfaction, they are fading, and uſeleſs in order to a Mans true Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn, 1. Though the Lord might juſtly have made this Life bitter, and a begun Hell to all the poſterity of Adam, and doth ſee it fitting to imbitter it to ſome of his own deareſt Children, that they may long for a better, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.13.14. And to others, that they may be puniſhed for ſeeking their Happineſs in this <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. yet generally he hath imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſweetneſs and comfort on Mans Condition here, that he may prove himſelf bountiful to all, incite them to his praiſe, and lead them to Repentance, Man hath himſelf to blame for any bitterneſs that is in his Lot: For, that the Lord doth afford matter of Sweetneſs and Comfort to every Man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this conceſſion, <hi>Truely the Light is ſweet,, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the choiſeſt of Earthly Comforts are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, in compariſon of thoſe that are Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as Men ſatiſfie themſelves with them for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet in themſelves, and in reference to the uſe which Man ſhould make of them. <hi>viz,</hi> to be thereby incouraged in his Maſters ſervice, and induced to ſeek after Comforts of a better nature, they are to be eſteemed of and commended: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here commend all lawful outward Comforts, while he ſaith, <hi>truely the Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="521" facs="tcp:51442:285"/>3. When the Lord prolongs a Mans Life, and gives him many outward Comforts, and few croſſes along the ſame, he is then very ready to forget Death and Eternity, and neglect to prepare for them; and the nearer he draw toward them, to be the more unmindful of them, therefore the Spirit of God finds it neceſſary to mind Man in this caſe of Death and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, <hi>But if a Man live many Years and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of Darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is Mens Wiſdom timouſly to intertain thoughts of Death and Eternity, and while they have health, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits are vigorous, to ſet about Duties wherein true preparation for theſe doth conſiſt, and to mix thoughts of that kind, with the moſt pleaſant paſſages of their Life, that they may be kept from exceſs in the uſe of Earthly delights, and may not put off ſuch thoughts and duties, as Melancholious and painful, till Death and Eternity be drawing near: For, as appears by the following purpoſe, this exhortation is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed to ſuch as have much of their time before them, <hi>yet let him remember the Days of Darkneſs, for they ſhall be many.</hi>

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:51442:286"/>
coming never ſo faſt upon him, he ſhould ſtill be thinking them empty of ſatisfaction and evanid: For how great ſoever his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes be, yet ſaith the Spirit of God to him, <hi>let him remember that—all that cometh is vanity.</hi>

The one is that they ſhould <hi>remove Sorrow from their Heart,,</hi> they thought to do this by their ſinful pleaſures, but he imports they were increaſing grief to themſelves, and <hi>Wrath</hi> (as the word tranſlated <hi>Sorrow</hi> ſignifies) even the wrath of God againſt their own Souls. The other expreſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the way how they ſhould <hi>remove Sorrow from their heart,</hi> to wit, by <hi>putting away evil from their Fleſh,</hi> whereby is, meant the forſaking of theſe ſinful pleaſures, in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or outward man, is mainly inſtrumental.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Fourthly</hi> he doth endeavour the ſame, by a reaſoon tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the vanity or ſinfulneſs of Mens Conception and Birth, which ſhould move them to cry for a change of their nature: for the firſt word tranſlated <hi>Child-hood</hi> relates to Mens Conception and the time between that and their Birth, and the other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Youth</hi> relates to their Birth and ſome time following, for it ſignifies the Morning or break of day; both which are full of ſinful vanity, rather to be lamented than continued in.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Thoſe who give up themſelves to their ſinful pleaſures, may juſtly fear that God ſhall give them up alſo to follow their own way, to their eternal ruine, and that as they ſcorn his pains, and often mock his Meſſengers, ſo he ſhall mock them, and ſcorn the Scorners: For, this Holy Irony
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:51442:287"/>
is to beget Fears in their Hearts, leſt God give them utterly up to themſelves. <hi>Rejoice, O young Man in thy youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where Gods powerful renewing Grace hath not lighted upon Mens Heart, they will not only take pleaſure in Sin, but they will provoke themſelves to more and more wickedneſs, and if Light or Conſcience would make reluctancy, they will ſpurr their Hearts over the Belly of it, and will <hi>with-hold themſelves</hi> from nothing which gives preſent ſatisfaction, were it never ſo diſhonourable to God, and deſtructive to their Souls Peace and Felicity. For this Ironical Speech expreſſes the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a bold Sinners Heart to himſelf. <hi>Rejoice in thy youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſts Miniſters muſt ſtudy variety of Strains for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of Sinners, ſometimes they muſt labour to terrifie by Threatnings, ſometimes allure by Promiſes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath done before, and ſometimes labour to make Men aſhamed by Holy Ironies, and ſcorning of their ſcornful Carriage, and ſpeak to them in their own ſtrain, as they uſe to ſpeak to their own Hearts, and one to another, providing they do thereby intend their Reclamation, not their Irritation, that they be not deſirous of a woful day upon them, that they intertain Pity and Grief in their Hearts, to ſee Men going cheerfully to their own Ruine, and that they intermix with their ſtrain, informations of their Hazard, and loving Counſels, expreſſing ſome hope of them, and holding forth to them the way how they may be reclaimed, as here this heavenly Preacher doth. <hi>Rejoice, O young Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But know God will bring thee to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore remove Sorrow from thy Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Men have abundance of earthly Pleaſures, and are in a capacity to enjoy the ſweetneſs of them, they are then in great hazard to baniſh all ſerious Thoughts of Death and the

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſerious and believing Conſideration of that Great Day of Judgement, is a ſpecial Mean to abate Mens eagerneſs in the purſuit of their carnal Pleaſures: And therefore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be ſerious and frequent in ſtirring them up to the conſideration of it. For the Spirit of God finds this to be moſt pertinent to be put as a Bridle in the Jaws of inſolent Youth, to reſtrain it from exceſs in carnal Pleaſures, <hi>But know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgement.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The laſt Judgement will be ſo exact, that not the leaſt ſinful motion of wicked Mens Hearts, ſhall paſs without notice, and deſerved Puniſhment, Men muſt not only give account there of their groſs out breaking Sins, but of their inward cheering and encouraging their Hearts to follow theſe Sins: For ſpeaking of young Mens cheering their Hearts in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Courſes, and in the ſight of their Eyes, he ſaith, <hi>For all theſe things God ſhall bring thee in to Judgement.</hi>

For the Man to whom he ſpeaks Verſe 9, as cheering his own Heart in his Sin, and baniſhing Thoughts of Judgement, he ſuppoſes here in the 10 Verſe, to have much

                  <p>IN the Firſt Part of this Chapter contained to the <hi>8</hi> Verſe, the Preacher continueth his purpoſe begun in the end of the laſt Chapter, which is to ſtirr up Men to a ſerious and timous preparation for Death and Judgement: And in order thereto doth <hi>(1)</hi> preſs the exerciſe of a Duty very fit and neceſſary for that end, to <hi>Remember their Creator,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver 1.</hi> where <hi>(1)</hi> we have the Duty it ſelf, which is to <hi>Remember,</hi> a Word importing a clear up-taking of God and His Attributes, an affectionat and cordial Truſting in Him, and an Engagement to the Duties of New Obedience. <hi>ver. 1. 2.</hi> The ſeaſon fitteſt for diſcharge of that Duty, not only the preſent <hi>Now,</hi> but the time of <hi>Youth. ver. 1.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> The Argument whereby he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this Duty, taken from the ſad Condition that every Man is to expect under Old Age, with reference to the Trouble and Afflictions incident to it, and the continuance of theſe Afflictions upon him, and the Language that ſuch will have at ſuch a time, far different from what they had in their Youth. <hi>ver. 1. 2.</hi> He doth negatively deſcribe the fitteſt Opportunities for the performance of theſe Duties neceſſary, in order to the preparing for Death, as that it should not be deferred till the Miſeriei of Old Age creep on, nor till the frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of outward afflictions, eſpecially Diſeaſes. <hi>ver. 2.</hi> In the dimneſs of the bodily Eyes, the uſefulneſs of external Lights, and the fatling of the Reaſon, held forthly the Allegories of the Sun, Moon and Stars, being darkned, and in the continual ſucceſſion (as one Cloud or Shower after another cometh in time of Winter) of one Trouble after another. <hi>ver. 2. 3.</hi> The Preacher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively evinceth the time of Old Age not to be ſo fit an Opportunity for making peace with God, in order to preparation for Death, as the time of Youth and Health, an old Mans Body being ſo beſet with Death (as a beſeiged Caſtle) that the Arms and Hands (called the <hi>Keepers of the Houſe</hi>) do shake, the Legs and Thighs <hi>(the ſtrong Men)</hi> grow feeble, the Teeth <hi>(the Grinders)</hi> turn few, looſe, and unfit for preparing Meat for the Stomach, and the Eyes (which took out at their Holes as Windows) grow dim and weak. <hi>ver. 3. 4.</hi> He by ſeveral other Metaphors, deſcribeth the diſſolution of this Houſe of Clay, or earthly Tabernacle, as by the <hi>Shutting of the Doors in the Street,</hi> importing the unfitneſs of the Mouth and Lips to ſpeak, or Throat (which are the Doors of the Tabernacle) to let down Meat, By <hi>the low ſounding of the Grinders,</hi>

                  <p>THe Scope of this Heavenly Preacher in the firſt part of this Chapter being to ſtir up Men to make tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preparation for Death and Judgement, he doth in this verſe Firſt preſs that Exerciſe which mainly fits Men for appearing before their Judge, in theſe words <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> Whereby according to the frequent uſe of the word in Scripture is meant, that Men ſhould labour to intertain ſuch clear thoughts of the properties of God, particularly his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and terrour, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.14.

                  <p>Next, He points out the ſeaſon fitteſt for the diſcharge of of this duty, and that is the preſent <hi>Now,</hi> and eſpecially the days of Mens <hi>youth,</hi> not as if theſe who have never gone about this duty till Youth be paſt, were not here ſpoken to, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time of Mens Youth is of all other the fitteſt for that Exerciſe.</p>

The other is, <hi>and the years wherein thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them,</hi> whereby is meant the time of the long continuance of trouble, which every man ſhould prepare for toward the evening of his Life, in which neither ſinful pleaſures, nor the moſt lawful earthly delight, ſhall be ſweet to men, but they ſhall be forced to expreſs as they ſhall be able, their loathing of the ſame, and therefore ſeing all men ought to expect ſuch a time as this before them, it is every mans Wiſdom, to ſtudy that which may yeild true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and comfort to his heart in the worſt times that can come, and that is only Gods favour and fellowſhip to be found in the way of his fear and obedience. afterward recommended.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. It is not the naked contemplation, or bare notions of God and his properties, that will prepare men rightly for Death, or yeild them true comfort at that time, but it is the Heart-affecting and practical meditation of him, whereby men cheriſh ſuch thoughts of him as draw forth their affections upon him, and make them frame their walk to his Honour, for that is the force of the original word, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propriety of the original language, and the uſe of it in Scripture as was cleared in the Expoſition, <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though there be no conſideration of God, under which the Scripture holds him out, which is not uſeful and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fore us, yet theſe of his ſoveraignity and omnipotency, which the Relation of a Creator offers to reaſonable Creatures, ſhould be moſt frequently cheriſhed, eſpecially by men who have ſtrong paſſions and Luſts to be mortified, and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements

to graple with in the way of their duty, that ſo they may take him up as One able eaſily to ſubue theſe Luſts, and make a new Creation upon their Souls, or if they continue voluntary Slaves to them, able to deſtroy them being their Creator, and if they give themſelves up to his obedience, able to bear them thorow all difficulties 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. and to creat peace and comfort in their Spirits, to make up the loſs of any comfort they can renounce for his ſake <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.18.19. for which and the like reaſons we may conceive the Lord as Creator, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the remembrance of Men who have ſtrongeſt Luſts unſubdued, and apprehend greateſt difficulty in renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſures of them, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not poſſible to get the Heart drawn from Earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and ſo ingaged to the fear and obedience of the Lord, unleſs it be ſtayed upon him, and repleniſhed with frequent thoughts of his properties, which will bring in ſo much Holy aw of him, and ſuch apprehenſions of ſweetneſs to be bad in him, that ſinful pleaſures will appear to be but Husks, or Swins food in compariſon thereof, and the Soul will not dare to feed upon theſe Husks, if it have clear and frequent thoughts of the ſoveraignity and power of God, the Creator, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſwaded from carnal pleaſures, in the cloſe of the former Chapter, and being afterward in this to recommend to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of living in the fear of obedience of the Lord, as the only way to true Happineſs, he doth here preſs this, <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> as the beſt way to divert the Heart, from the one, and ingage it to the other.</p>

This being clear, and generally agreed upon by Interpreters to be the Scope of this place, we need not be very anxious concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particular application of the Allegories here made uſe of to ſet forth this purpoſe.</p>

The darkening of the dying Mans bodily <hi>Eyes.</hi> And ſo 2. Of all external <hi>Lights</hi> to him, as to any Comfort he may reap from them. As alſo 3. The decaying of his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his Soul, as are in a manner anſwerable to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Lights. And likewayes 4.

                     <hi>Next.</hi> By the <hi>Returning of the Clouds after Rain,</hi> ſeems clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be underſtood that continual Succeſſion, and frequent returning of one Shower of Trouble after another, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall dying Men: And the Allegory or Similitude ſeems to be borrowed from the tempeſtuous and ſtormy Seaſons of the Year, when it is not as in Summer, that after a Shower clears up again, and becomes fair and Warm, which repreſents the time of Youth, in which ordinarily after ſome fit of Sickneſs and Diſtemper, comes Eaſe and Health again: But as it is in
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:51442:293"/>
Winter, after one Shower the Clouds preſently gather for another; ſo will it be in the time of Old Age. As for that Particular which many condeſcend upon as intended here, to wit, the frequent falling down of Rheums or Catarrhes from the Head, like ſo many Showers upon the Lungs, that ſeems to be but one Inſtance of this general, to wit, the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring of one Fit of Diſtemper after another, incident to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn 1. It is not enough for Men to have general Apprehenſions of their Mortality, and the certainty of their Death, but it is neceſſary that their Thoughts be ſtayed upon the Diſtinct, and particular Apprehenſion of the Caſe they ſhall be in, at that time, while the ſeveral Pinns of their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhall be a looſing, that by a ſerious and conſiderat view of their Caſe then, they may be ſtirred up to provide ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpiritual Conſolations againſt the removal of every one of their outward Comforts: Therefore is it that <hi>Solomon</hi> after a general Intimation in the former Verſe, that Death and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are before Men, he comes here more particularly to lead them to diſtinct Thoughts of the Caſe they ſhall be in then, <hi>While the Sun, or the Light, or the Moon, or the Stars be not darkened.</hi>

The benefit of our Eyes, and of the Light of the Sun, as alſo our Reaſon, and other Faculties of the Soul, together with the Comforts we have by the uſe of all theſe, are excellent Mercies of God, and while they are continued with us, do put us in a good capacity to prepare for Death: While we have the uſe of our bodily Eyes, and our Reaſon, we may contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plat the glorious Works of God, and read his Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may attain to the Knowledge of God in Chriſt, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him: For which end all theſe Lights, whether of our Eyes, our Reaſon, the external Lights of Heaven, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be ſet forth by theſe Names, are given to us: For this is a part of the deſcription of that Opportunity to be made

                  <p>HEre is a farther deſcription of the caſe that Men ſhall be in when Death is drawing near unto them, held forth in ſeveral expreſſions. The firſt two <hi>they ſhall be affraid of that which is high, and fears ſhall be in the way,</hi> are to the ſame purpoſe, and do both ſignify the want of Strength and courage, and the fearful apprehenſions incident to Dying Men, particularly by <hi>that which is high</hi> may be meant any ſtep of their way which is higher than another, and the leaſt ſtumbling Block in their way, which is to a crazy decayed Man ſuch as <hi>Solomon</hi> here
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:51442:297"/>
deſcribes, is matter of fear leaſt it make him fall, conſidering how hurtful a fall may prove to him, and how hardly he would be ſet to his Feet again; And ſo the words ſuppoſe the Dying Man yet able to ſtep up and down, as ſome will be till very near the time of their Removal: Or by <hi>that which is high,</hi> and <hi>the fears in the way,</hi> may be meant the leaſt Trouble, were it but the weight of a hand above the Dying Perſon, or any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about them which is to them terrible, and makes them fear leaſt it increaſe their pain.</p>
                  <p>Next by <hi>the flouriſhing of the Almond Tree</hi> may be meant the haſtening of the perſons Death, ſo the allegory or ſimilitude is uſed <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.11. becauſe that Tree flouriſhes near the end of Winter, and conſequently it may ſignify alſo the Decay of their Strength, whereof Gray Hairs, which reſemble in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the Flouriſhes of the Almond Tree, are a Sign: As on the contrary this ſame Heavenly Writter doth ſet forth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Strength of Youth in a ſpiritual ſenſe, by the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> (where Gray Hairs firſt appear) compared to a piece of <hi>Pomegranat</hi> which is Rudie and white <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.7. Or the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may have this ſenſe (which is to the ſame purpoſe) that the Blood being now retired toward the Heart of the Dying Man, the pale white Clay appears like the Flouriſhes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Tree.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Expreſſion, <hi>the Graſhoper ſhall be a Burden,</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies alſo the great Decay of Strength, in ſo much that the lighteſt thing were it but a Gnat, or Graſhopper lighting upon the Face of the Dying Man, ſhall be a burden to him, and yet he ſhall not be able to put it away.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is in more plain and proper Terms, that <hi>Deſire,</hi> to wit, after all Earthly Objects, whether Lawful, ſuch as Meat, Drink, Marriage, Delight, and the like, or Unlawful, ſuch as Revengeful, Ambitious, Luſtful deſires Reckoned out 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. ſhall now cool and be quite extinguiſhed.</p>

Home,</hi> or as the Original is, <hi>to the houſe of Eternity</hi> or Ages, whereby is meant that eſtate, wherein the Soul muſt be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, without any farther change.</p>
                  <p>And for the laſt Expreſſion <hi>the Mourners going about the Streets,</hi> the meaning of it is, that the Man being now given over as Dead, the perſons made uſe of in theſe times to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the Funerals, were already conveening and waiting on: Or the Dying Mans Friends are now going out from him, and already beginning their Mourning for his Death: It is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before this time come to make ſure work of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in Chriſt, and to provide ſome ſutable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Spirit, while the Body ſhall be in this Condition.</p>

the Winter of this Life; and labour to have Grace ſo Lively that in regard of the Exerciſe of it, they may Flouriſh even in Old Age <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92.12. And ſtudy to have their Hoary Head found in the way of Righteouſneſs a Crown of Glory to them <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. And while they are Young and Strong, not to Glory in ſuch Excrementitious things as their Hair, which will ſhortly be like the <hi>Almond Tree;</hi> ſo ſhall they prepare for this ſtate ſet forth under this ſimilitude; <hi>and the Almond Tree ſhall Flouriſh.</hi>
                  </p>

God will once before men go off this World, cut off all their <hi>Deſires</hi> from Earthly Objects that Wicked men finding themſelves to abhor theſe Sinful Delights which once they did ſo ardently deſire, may be the more convinced of their Folly and Madneſs, and that the Godly finding their lawful Earthly Delights loathſom to them, may Rejoice that Delights of a better nature are abiding them; the conſideration whereof ſhould move all to mortify their ſinful, and moderat their lawful deſires after things Earthly, and to have their Hearts filled with Heavenly Deſires which ſhall be ſatisfied, and yet ſhall never fail, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23.

Though the Men of this World whoſe beſt portion is in this preſent life, promiſe to themſelves a perpetuity of injoying things Earthly <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49.12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. yet they ſhall find them ſelves within a little miſerably diſappointed, they ſhall find that this is not their Home, it were Wiſdom to look upon their Manſions here, as ſhort Homes to them, and upon themſelves as Strangers and Pilgrims, that ſo they might give all diligence to enſure to themſelves Everlaſting Habitations: For, when Death comes, <hi>Man goes to his long Home.</hi>

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:51442:299"/>
Men ſhould Remember their Creator, which is to make ſure work of their Peace with him, before they be deprived of all their outward Ornaments, and neceſſary Commodities of this Life, or the Inſtruments of their Imployment, whatſoever it be; yet it ſeems moſt ſutable to the ſtrain of the Preacher in the former purpoſe, to look upon the Words, as containing ſo many ſweet Allegories or Similitudes, to ſet forth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay or diſſolution of the moſt noble parts of this earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</p>
                  <p>The Similitudes are borrowed from a <hi>Fountain</hi> or <hi>Well,</hi> about which is built ſome curious Engine for drawing up the Water, with a ſilver Cord or Chain, to let down a golden Bowl or Pitcher, or ſome ſuch Veſſel to lift up the Water; which Similitude doth fitly point out the humane Body, which hath a Fountain of natural Life, and Spirits within it, and ſo many excellent Inſtruments to convoy and impart the ſame to the ſeveral parts of the Body, all which at Death will be looſed and broken to peices. And though this general Senſe might be ſatisfactory and uſeful as to the Scope, which is to ſtirr up Men to Remember their Creator, before theſe noble Parts be decayed, and it may be thought ſafe to enquire no farther anent the Particulars intended by every part of the Similitude, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it ſeems now to be very uncertain by what Names theſe noble Parts of the Body, the Heart, Brain, Liver, and the like, were called and diſtinguiſhed one from another, among the Hebrews in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, and by what Similitudes they were ſet out, which make great diverſity among Interpreters, in expounding and applying of them: And conſidering alſo that there are ſeveral of theſe Parts, which may be repreſented by diverſe parts of this Similitude; yet we ſhall mention what is moſt univerſally agreed upon, to be pointed at by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Allegory here made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> By <hi>the ſilver Cord</hi> is meant, the Marrow of the Back-bone, compared to a ſilver Cord, becauſe much of the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:51442:300"/>
ſtrength of the Body lyeth in it, in ſo much as without it Men would creep upon the Earth as Worms do, and becauſe in colour it reſembles a <hi>ſilver Cord,</hi> the <hi>looſing</hi> of it is the weakening of it, when the Spirits withdraw from it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes cold, and loſes the force of it. The Similitude may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſignify ſome of the prime Arteries, or Strings of the Heart, which thence convey the Vital Spirits to the Liver, and other parts of the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, The golden Bowl,</hi> is taken from that yellow thin Skin containing the Brain within the Skull, which is broken when the Pores of it are much opened to let in the Air, as falls out near the time of Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, The Pitcher at the Fountain.</hi> is thought to point out a great hollow Vein, ſomewhat in form or figure like a <hi>Pitcher,</hi> which doth receive from the Liver, here called the <hi>Cistren,</hi> Nutriment, now turned by the Liver into Blood, to be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reſt of the Members, and this is <hi>broken</hi> when it is obſtructed, or the operation and office of it impeded, near the time of Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By <hi>the Wheel at the Ciſtren,</hi> are meant the Lungs, the prime Inſtruments of the Breath and Voice, which are ſet out by this Similitude, becauſe, like the Wheel of a Fountain, they are ſtill in motion, drawing down, and ſending up the Breath again, as the Wheel is ſtill ſending down, or drawing up the Bucket: This <hi>Wheel is broken at the Cistren,</hi> when thorow the abundance of watry Humours or Phlegm, filling the Stomach, they ceaſe from their motion and operation, and ſo brings Death.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt Words of the Chapter are to be knit with this, as with all the former to this purpoſe, <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor before</hi> this Caſe come, and timouſly make Peace with Him, that thou mayeſt have peace in this day.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. Men ſhould not deſpiſe humane Learning, and the knowledge or ſcience of natural Things, were it for no
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:51442:300"/>
more but to help them to underſtand the Fabrick of their own Bodies: And although every Man's Gift is not to be laid aſide as to the publick imploying thereof, becauſe he wants ſuch and ſuch a meaſure of humane Learning, ſeing the Lord hath made eminent uſe of ſome who wanted it, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. as he hath done alſo of others, who have been eminently endued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. and 22.3. yet every Mans ſhort-ſightedneſs therein ſhould humble him, and move him to beſtow ſome of his time for attaining to it, eſpecially conſidering that Mans Body is ſo wonderful a peice of Artifice, that without the help of theſe Sciences which deſcribe the ſame, hardly can ſuch Scriptures as this be made clear. <hi>Ere the ſilver Cord be looſed.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord hath wiſely ordered that Death ſhould aſſault, and take down this Tabernacle of our Body by degrees; and looſe at leaſure the ſeveral Pinns thereof, firſt weakening the out-works, and then ſetting upon the inward, that every Stroak and Aſſault may be a Warning for a farther, and that when Men find their Hands trembling, or their Legs enfeebled, their Eyes dim, or their Ears dull of Hearing, they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for an Aſſault upon the Heart and other noble Parts: For after <hi>Solomon</hi> hath deſcribed the diſſolution of ſeveral other parts of the Body, he comes here to the inmoſt and moſt noble parts thereof, that Men may be ſtirred up to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator at leaſt <hi>Ere the ſilver Cord be looſed, or the golden Bowl be broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the Organs of the Body, eſpecially the more noble parts thereof are very excellent pieces of Work, and to be ſo eſteemed of, not ſo much for the ſubſtance of them, as for the Divine Art which is manifeſted in the framing of them; and the excellent uſes they ſerve for: And therefore both theſe, and the Powers and Faculties of the Soul, which reſide in, and act by theſe, are to be uſed holily, Mans ſtrength here mainly held out by <hi>the ſilver Cord</hi> ſhould be eſteemed more precious
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:51442:301"/>
than to be ſpent upon his Luſts, he ſhould beware of filling this <hi>golden Bowl,</hi> his Brain, wherein theſe excellent Faculties, his Imagination and Memory have their prime Reſidence, with unclean, ambitious, revengeful Speculations, and ſuch like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, and by Intemperance and Exceſs to ſpoil this <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> corrupt this <hi>Cistren,</hi> and break this <hi>Wheel,</hi> his Liver, Lungs and other parts, which may be ſignified by theſe Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and ſo do what he can to be his own Deſtroyer: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe parts of the Body ſet out here by ſuch elegant Metaphors or Similitudes borrowed from very precious things, <hi>The ſilver Cord, the golden Bowl,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe parts of the Body which are moſt excellent and durable, are to be looked upon as very brittle, and fading, and therefore a Houſe not made with Hands to be enſured, and this frail Body only ſo far reſpected and cared for, as it may be the more inſtrumental in doing the Lord Service while we have it: Therefore are the moſt noble Parts of the Body here repreſented by <hi>A golden Bowl, a Pitcher and a Wheel.</hi>

The Bodies of Men at Death go not as their Spirits to that ſtate wherein they muſt be Eternally, but as they were at firſt taken out of the Earth, ſo they muſt go thither for a time, the Lord hath ſo ordered, that whereby he may prove and Exerciſe his peoples Faith concerning the Reſurrection: For, ſaith he, <hi>The dust ſhall return to the Earth as it was.</hi>

                  <p>IN this and the following Verſes is contained the laſt part of the Chapter, and the cloſe of the whole Book, wherein the Preacher doth briefly Summ up, and by ſeveral Arguments commend the purpoſe contained in it, which for Methods cauſe we may take up in four Articles or Heads of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt which is in this Verſe, contains the Summ of the firſt Principal part of the Book, namely, that all Created things, and human endeavours about them, are vain or inſufficient for leading a Man to his true Happineſs: And this having been frequently held out before, is here neceſſarly Repeated that all may aſſent unto it, as a Truth now abundantly proven, and which the Preacher himſelf loved to meditate upon and writ, again and again; and with this Repeating of it, he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his calling to be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> as that which ſhould gain weight to every Truth delivered by him, and to this in particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:51442:303"/>Beſide what hath been obſerved from this purpoſe before, We may Learn. 1. Neceſſary Truths muſt not be caſt by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are clear to us, and ſufficiently proven to be Truths by many Arguments, neither will they become loathſome to a Holy Mind, but ought to be intertained and meditate upon till we find motions ſutable thereunto, wakened in our Hearts, and ſome Fruits in our practice anſwerable to them, which may evidence we do truly know and believe them, and the more clear ſuch Truths are to a Gracious Sool, the ſweeter they will grow, and the more delight will the Soul have to dwell upon them; Therefore doth <hi>Solomon,</hi> after he hath fully proven and cleared this Truth, and frequently aſſerted it, here again repreſent the ſame to his own Heart and others, <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So prone are our Hearts to wander after Earthly Delights as our only Happineſs, that even after they have been in ſome meaſure divorced from the ſame, there is great need often to view the Vanity of theſe things, as we deſire to keep our Hearts alienat from them, and in love with that true ſweetneſs which is to be had in Communion with God, while we are in this life, we are (like Children newly weaned) very ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new old acquaintance with the Breaſts. Therefore doth <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> after frequent Repeating of this Truth along this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Mortification, Repeat it here again in the cloſe of it, that he may keep his Heart alienat from Idols, <hi>Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When Miniſters have ſufficiently proven, illuſtrat and made uſe of the Truth propoſed by them to be handled, it is no vain Repetition for them to repreſent the ſame Truth in the very Terms in which they did propoſe it at firſt, that by the Bleſſing of God upon their proofs, illuſtrations and uſes of it, it may now at laſt have more hearty acceptance, and take deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impreſſion than could be expected at firſt: For ſo doth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here Repeat the Truth he propoſed in the entry of this
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:51442:303"/>
Book, after he hath cleared, proven and made uſe of the ſame, <hi>Vanity of Vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Men ſee <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the <hi>Beauty</hi> of it, Sin in the hazard of it, and Death in the certainty and terrour of it, they cannot but ſee the <hi>Vanity</hi> of Earthly Delights conſidered as the object of Mans Happineſs, they cannot but ſee the emptineſs and inſufficiency of them in order to that end, ſeing they diſtract the Heart from the Study of Holineſs, and marre preparation for Death, and conſequently Men that baniſh thoughts of Death, and neglect the ſtudy of Holineſs cannot but be raviſhed with Earthly Delights, as the only ſubſtantial things worthy of their Heart, and to be ſought as their chief good, for we may ſafely conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> here after many ſweet Precepts concerning the ſtudy of Holineſs, and lively Repreſentations of Death to his own Heart, and others, to have gotten a new ſight of the Vanity of things Earthly, and to invite others to paſs ſentence thereupon with him <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Man that hath a call to Preach the Truth of God, ſhould eſteem more of it, than of the moſt Honourable outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Title he can have beſide, he ſhould carry the thoughts of Gods calling and entruſting of him, along in his Heart, to make him confident of Furniture even to the end of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and people alſo ſhould frequently remember the calling of ſent Miniſters, that the Truths delivered may have the greater weight as coming to them from Gods Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Officers. For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> took this for his firſt ſtile in the beginning of his Book, even while he was Reckoning out ſome others, ſo he mentions it alone in the cloſe as his main incouragement, and that which ſhould mainly gain reſpect to his Meſſage, <hi>Vanity of Vanities</hi> ſaith the <hi>Preacher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. When we have gone thorow many particular inſtances of theſe Earthly Delights wherein Men place their Happineſs, and have attained to convincing proofs of the Vanity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:51442:304"/>
of them for that end, we ought then to raiſe our Hearts to an aſſent to the truth of the general, that all of that ſort are Vanity, and not leave room ſtill to Satan, to keep our perverſe Hearts in ſuſpenſe and expectation that there may be ſome Earthly Delight which we have not yet ſeen, more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the reſt, and ſo keep us off all our time from ſeeking Happineſs in that wherein it can only be found: For after <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hath confuted many particular inſtances of theſe things wherein Men ordinarly ſeek their Happineſs, he now aſſerts the general, and holds out to all for their aſſent unto it, <hi>all is Vanity.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſecond article or Concluſion of this Book contains a Commendation of the purpoſe contained in it, and this hath three Branches: The firſt is from the Preacher himſelf, whoſe qualifications and pains are ſet forth in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in this Verſe. 1. He had a good ſtock of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly infuſed. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. and by his extraordinary pains acquired <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.13. 2. He did improve the ſame well for the Inſtruction of the Church in all ages, eſpecially theſe under his charge, here called <hi>the People.</hi> 3. He was very aſſiduous and conſtant in this Work, <hi>he ſtill taught,</hi> either by frequent Preaching, and Exhortation, as a publick Officer of the Church (ſuch as he was) ſhould do, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. Or by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Miniſters to their duty, and incouraging them in it, as a Religious King like him, ſhould do 2 <hi>Chr</hi> 7.8.9. Or by writting Scripture as an extraordinary Prophet, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (being Dead) he yet ſpeaketh, <hi>and still teacheth the People Knowledge.</hi> 4. He reſted not upon any meaſure he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>but gave good heed,</hi> or as the word in the original is, he
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:51442:304"/>
                     <hi>Weighed</hi> every thing in the Ballance, <hi>and ſought out,</hi> carefully more and more of the Knowledge of God, and of Mans duty, that he might edify the Church. 5. He did <hi>wiſely order,</hi> and digeſt the purpoſe he delivered. 6. He condeſcended upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of matter ſutable to many caſes of the People. And 7. He contrived the ſame in ſuch ſhort and grave Sentences, here called <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as are apt to gain eſteem, and have prevalence in the minds of Men, as the word rendered <hi>Proverbs</hi> ſignifies <hi>he ſet in order many Proverbs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. Though the worth or qualifications of Inſtruments can add nothing to the Authority of the truth of God, which is of it ſelf worthy <hi>of all Acceptation,</hi> who ever carry it, yet ſo ready are people to lay hold upon every thing that may but ſeem to be a ground of caſting at Truth, that the Veſſels that carry it, had need not only to be without ſpot and blemiſh, but alſo adorned with ſuch accompliſhments as may make them lovely to people, that ſo there may be no ground from them to caſt at their Meſſage: For here the Spirit of God finds it neceſſary to commend the Veſſel that carried the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this Book to the Church, thereby to gain the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance to it, <hi>And moreover becauſe the Preacher was wife, he still caught,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As every Chriſtian is bound humbly to avow the Graces and Gifts of God beſtowed upon him, when the Glory of God, and the incouragement and edification of others require the ſame, ſo it is eſpecially ſutable for Miniſters, when their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is Honeſt and ſincere, namely to make Truth, not themſelves only, in eſteem. As they ſhould be ready to declare themſelves ſenſible of, and humble for their failings, when the ſame may Glorify God or edify others, ſo ſhould they alſo be, to avow what Graces God hath given them, eſpecially their qualifications for their calling, when the Lord hath born Teſtimony to the ſame by his Bleſſing upon their Labours; they muſt not ſo fear the ſuſpicion of ſelf-ſeeking, as always to
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:51442:305"/>
conceal the Lords liberality toward them; but whenſoever it may ſerve to make way for his Truth, they ought humbly to declare the ſame, as here this exemplary <hi>Preacher</hi> doth. <hi>And moreover becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he still taught</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greater meaſure of gifts eſpecially of Knowledge and underſtanding of the matters of God, any Man have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, the more careful ſhould he be to communicat the ſame for the good of others in his place and ſtation, this being the end for which they are given. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. And the ſame being rewarded as if it were gain and advantage to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. As likewiſe the Communication of our gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way to make them grow <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. For, <hi>Solomon</hi> did therefore teach the people Knowledge <hi>becauſe he was wiſe,</hi> and the words may be rendered <hi>the greater abundance of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he had, the more he taught the People Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Albeit Chriſts Miniſters cannot be alwiſe about the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcharge of the duties of their Calling, yet ought they to be very aſſiduous and frequent therein, and in ſome ſenſe ſtill about their work, gathering variety of matter fit to be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat to the people <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.52. keeping their Hearts always in a right frame for the delivery of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.23. And watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all opportunities for Communicating the ſame. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. And when they have not Ability or opportunity to teach, their practice, and carriage muſt <hi>ſtill teach the people Knowledge</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. For, ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſet forth himſelf at the direction of the Spirit of God, as an example to all Preachers, becauſe the Preacher was wiſe <hi>he ſtill taught the People Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They that are moſt able to teach others, ſhould ſtill be Scholars themſelves, not only diligent Hearers of other Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may learn more, but acurate Searchers for all means and opportunities of profiting in Knowledge, there being ſtill more Knowledge to be had <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.13. and ſucceſs promiſed to the ſincere Seeker <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6: 3. For, though <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb n="561" facs="tcp:51442:305"/>
was Wiſe, and able to teach the People Knowledge, yet he was not ſo ſatisfied with his meaſure as to become Lazy, or give over farther pains for more, <hi>yea he gave good heed, and ſought out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhould neither raſhly receive, nor vent any thing for Truth, till firſt we have weighed and pondered the ſame, in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, by the exerciſe of ſanctified Reaſon, comparing the ſame with the Scripture, conſidering what particular Truths are moſt fitting for the People we have to do with, and what are the fitteſt Opportunities of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame: For ſo did <hi>Solomon,</hi> He <hi>gave good heed,</hi> the Word ſignifies to <hi>weigh</hi> in a Ballance, and <hi>he ſought out,</hi> which ſignifies very accurately and <hi>carefully to ſearch:</hi> And both may be referred either to what he himſelf received from others, or to what he gave out to others.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Even theſe of the Lords Servants who were immediatly furniſhed with Gifts for their Imployment, and infallibly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the exerciſe of them, were not exeemed from ordinary pains and diligence, to clear themſelves more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truths revealed to them, and to find out the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt way and ſeaſon, of delivering theſe Truths to the People, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10 How then ſhould ordinary Miniſters of meanner Parts and Gifts ſtretch their Abilities to the outmoſt, and improve much of their time in Prayer and Reading, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Gifts, and fitneſs for the exerciſe of them, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Man as <hi>Solomon,</hi> was thus exerciſed? <hi>He gave good heed, and ſought out, and ſet in order.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is no form of ſpeech that can be imagined preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with Reaſonable Creatures, but the Lord hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon it in his word, where we find Songs, and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, plain Language, and Parables, large inſiſting upon one purpoſe, and Proverbs, which are ſhort Sentences cleared by ſimilitudes, and ſo apt to prevail, and <hi>have Dominion</hi> (as
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:51442:306"/>
the word <hi>Proverb</hi> ſignifies) in the minds of Men, <hi>he ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many Proverbs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. As the caſes of the Lords People are various, Difficulties, Duties, Temptations, and Conſolations, Many; ſo the Lords Word is fitted for them all, it is divided in many parcels, and every one that handles it, ſhould labour to Enrich himſelf with much of it, that he may bring forth variety of it to People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their need: For, ſo did <hi>Solomon, he gave good heed and ſought out, and ſet in order many Proverbs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. There is a ſweet order and wiſe diſpoſal of the Truths ſet down in Scripture, though we ſeldom ſee it, by reaſon of our Darkneſs, and therefore Chriſts Miniſters ſhould digeſt and put in order the Truths they deliver to his people: He firſt Humbles, and then Comforts, He firſt gives Faith and then Holineſs, and (which is ſutable to the order of Doctrine in this Book) firſt weans Mens Hearts from Earthly Delights, before they can be ſet upon Heavenly: For though Men do leaſt apprehend a Method in <hi>Solomons</hi> Writtings of any other in Scripture, yet here the Spirit of God tells us that there is an order in them, <hi>He ſought out and ſet in order many Proverbs.</hi>

loving Relation of <hi>a Son,</hi> that ſo he may gain the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance to his Meſſage.</p>
                  <p>Next, He ſhews the principal uſe to be made of the things he had Written, and not of theſe only, but of all the <hi>Words of the Wiſe</hi> commended in the former verſe, that is of every meſſage of any ſent Miniſter of Chriſt, to wit, that <hi>by theſe Men ſhould be admoniſhed,</hi> the word ſignifies to be <hi>Inlightned,</hi> that is informed, and conſequently (according to the ſenſe of our Tranſlation) made <hi>Cautious</hi> and wary that they miſtake not in ſo great a matter as this, the diſcovery of the neareſt way to their true Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He preſſeth this by two Reaſons. The 1. Is in theſe words, <hi>for in making many Books there is no end,</hi> which cannot be underſtood of the Writting of many Books like this in hand, to wit Books of Scripture, ſeing after <hi>Solomons</hi> time there behooved to be many Books of this ſort made, for ſo he ſhould ſeem to have condemned the Writting of more Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and likewiſe there is an end put to the making of Books of that ſort, by cloſing theſe Books with a Curſe upon any that ſhould add to them <hi>Rev.</hi> 22, 18. but the meaning is, that if Men do not ſatisfy themſelves with that light, and theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions which are held out in this Book, and other Scriptures, they will become vain in their Imaginations, and every Man will fancy a new and nearer way to Happineſs than another, and out of his boundleſs deſire of vain Glory, will make no end of his Enquiry, but will ſpend the beſt of his time and ſtrength to vent his own Notions, and commend his vain Imaginations about the way to true Happineſs, and to confute others (as it is clear natural Men of the moſt refined Wits have done in many written Volumns) and conſequently it is clear he doth not condemn the Writting or ſtudy of other Books beſide the Scripture, providing they be Conſonant thereunto, but only of ſuch as oppoſe the Scripture, in ſo far as they pretend to point out a way to Happineſs contrary to what is held out therein,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:51442:310"/>
by the ſtudy whereof Mens Souls can never have true reſt nor quietneſs, till they cloſe with ſuch Truths as are held forth in this Book, <hi>which are as Nails fastened by the Maſters of Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> fixing and eſtabliſhing the Hearts of thoſe that receive them, concerning this main Querie, where their true Happineſs is to be had. 2. The ſecond reaſon is, that <hi>much ſtudy is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs to the Fleſh,</hi> he ſpeaks of every Study oppoſite to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Truth formerly commended, and the meaning is, that he who will apply himſelf to any other Study for attaining to true Happineſs, may well weary his Fleſh, he ſhall do no more good to himſelf, he ſhall bring no true profit, or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Soul, and therefore it is the part of every Child of Wiſdom, to apply himſelf to the making uſe of theſe Truths formerly commended.</p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. When Miniſters have held forth Light, and given warning to People concerning their Duty and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they muſt be very earneſt with them, to admit and make uſe of the ſame, and muſt not think themſelves ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exonered to have held forth Light, and given warning to people, unleſs they do their outmoſt to prevail with them to make uſe thereof: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here, after clear Light held forth concerning Mens Duty, and warning given of their Hazard in caſe they neglect it, he is moſt ſerious with them to make uſe of his pains, <hi>farther by theſe, my Son, be admoniſhed, or enlighened.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. This is the perfection of Scripture above all other Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the World, that every part of it which hath been by any Pen-man delivered to the Church, doth contain a perfect rule of Faith and Manners, ſo that no other Writtings beſide, or contrary to it, are neceſſary for ſupplying the defects of it: For <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſuppoſes that what he and others of the Lords Servants who lived before and in his time had Written (though then there was but a ſmall part of Holy Scripture delivered to the Church) was ſufficient to <hi>Admoniſh</hi> Men of their Duty, and

                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. It is neceſſary for Chriſts Miniſters that they have ſome certain Scope relating to the practice of the Lords people, at which they ſhould aim in all that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto them, and in the cloſe of any diſcourſe or part of their pains, they ſhould labour to leave ſome impreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as a Nail faſtened in their Hearts: For ſo doth <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſum up his Scope in this Book, and labour to fix the ſame in the Hearts of all men, <hi>let us hear the Concluſion of the whole matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever duty Miniſters preſs upon people in order to their peace and Happineſs, they ſhould imprint the ſame upon their own Hearts, and become Learners of theſe Leſſons they hold out to others, not <hi>binding heavy Burthens upon Mens Backs which they touch not with one of thir Fingers:</hi> For <hi>Solomon</hi> here makes himſelf a Hearer and Learner of his own Doctrine, while he ſaith <hi>Let us hear the Concluſion of the whole matter, fear God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No Man will ever be ſuch a proficient in the Study
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:51442:312"/>
of the fear and obedience of the Lord, as that he will not need to Learn more, and to advance in that ſtudy: For, <hi>Solomon</hi> was now near the cloſe of his days, and at a good degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that ſtudy, and yet he incites himſelf, and thoſe who are fartheſt advanced, to greater progreſs herein, <hi>fear God and keep his Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They that would ſee good Days and live in the Light of the Lords Countenance, muſt Learn to be in his fear all the day long, intertaining the Faith of his Greatneſs and Goodneſs, that ſo they may be kept from theſe things which impede their fellowſhip with him, in which their felicity conſiſts: For, while he ſums up his directions for attaining to true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he had proven impoſſible to be found in things Earthly, and only to be had in fellowſhip with God reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, he gives this for one principal part of that ſum <hi>fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Mans true Happineſs is only to be found in keeping of the Commands of God, he cannot expect a ſweet meeting with God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.5 nor the comfortable manifeſtations of his Love <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21.23. but in that way, for this is the other part of the ſum of his directions for attaining to true Happineſs which conſiſts in Communion with God, <hi>keep his Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The fear of the Lord is the root and principle of all right obedience to him, without which Men cannot act or move acceptably in any commanded duty: Therefore he preſſeth the Study of the fear of God in order to acceptable obedience, <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Where the fear of God is in the Heart, there will be alſo a care of keeping his Commands manifeſted in the practice, and that fear will evidence it ſelf by ſome endeavour after a ſutable walking to his Commands: For the keeping of the Commandements here preſſed, may be looked on as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fruit of the fear of God, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:51442:312"/>8. However Men that ſeek their Happineſs in this Earth do look upon the Study of the fear and obedience of the Lord, as no part of their buſineſs in order to the attaining of their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Happineſs, but rather an impediment in the way to it <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. yet this ſame Bleſſed Study is the great end for which man was made, the only ſtudy that is worthy to have his Spirit wholly Exerciſed about it, ſo as all his other Studies ought to be ſubordinat to this: And the conſideration hereof ſhould be a ſtrong motive to put him to it, as is imported in this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>For this is the whole duty of man.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Learn. 1. The beſt of Gods Children may have their Hearts ſometimes ſo hardned, and ſo averſe from his fear, and the duties of new obedience, that they had need to have that dreadful day of Judgement repreſented to them, as one of the <hi>Goads</hi> formerly mentioned, to keep their Hearts in aw, and to excite them to their Duty: For this Reaſon is held out as uſeful to be conſidered by all that deſire to be truly happy, and as that whereby <hi>Solomon</hi> preſt upon his own Heart the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:51442:313"/>
ſtudy of living in the fear and obedience of the Lord: For <hi>God will bring every work into Judgement,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So exact will the laſt Judgement be, that no action or purpoſe of Men ſhall eſcape the Cogniſance and Sentence of the Judge in that day, their publick Sins ſhall then be publiſhed to all, and their ſecret Sins, even theſe of their Hearts, which they have gotten altogether hid from the Eyes of the World, and which they ſtudied along their Life to hid them from their own Conſciences, by neglecting to ſearch them out, and Mourn for them, ſhall then be laid open; the conſideration whereof, ſhould deter Men from ſecret Sins: For (ſaith he) <hi>God will bring every work into Judgement with every ſecret thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. All the evil actions of Men which they now refuſe to look upon, that they might Mourn, and make uſe of the Blood of Chriſt for cleanſing of them, ſhall in that great day be ſet in the light of their Countenance, and made patent for their ſhame and terrour before Men and Angels, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for them deſerved Wrath to the outmoſt: This ſhould be conſidered by Men when they are tempted to Sin, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure impenitent Slighters of their former Wickedneſs; For, <hi>God will bring every Work into Judgement, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
